 * created. (Observed 2026-08-08: `vibes-frontdoor` and `vibes-lfgpin`, both
 * hand-made worktrees of ~/repos/vibes, reaped 22 minutes apart.)
 *
 * The marker lives OUTSIDE the worktree so it never shows up as an untracked
 * file — which `captureWorktreeSnapshot` below would otherwise fold into the
 * WIP commit it takes before removal — and so it cannot dirty a branch a
