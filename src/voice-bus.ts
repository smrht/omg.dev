// Fleet completion bus.
//
// Turns "a session just completed a turn" into a PUSH:
//
//   - a single background watcher samples each session's busy state on an
//     interval and detects busy -> idle transitions (= a session landed work),
//   - it fans those out as events to any subscriber,
//   - session-push.ts subscribes and delivers a Web Push notification, so you
//     hear about a landed turn with the app closed.
//
// (Named for the voice assistant it was originally built for; that phone-call
// feature is gone, but the bus is now load-bearing for Web Push.)
//
// The watcher is process-global and idempotent (one loop regardless of how many
// subscribers connect). Busy detection reuses the exact signals the live view
// already streams: a tmux pane via isBusy(), a pane-less aisdk/codex/opencode
// session via the registry's isEntryBusy().
