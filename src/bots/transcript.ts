/**
 * What of a bot session's transcript the human is meant to see.
 *
 * A bot's backing session is an ordinary session, so its transcript carries
 * launch plumbing the bot chat must not show: the runtime contract, a prior
 * conversation summary on relaunch, and the `[Message from ...]` attribution
 * wrapper on every turn.
 *
 * The subtle part is the launch turn. The first user message is deliberately
 * bundled *into* the launch prompt — sending it separately raced the boot and
 * the bot answered neither, so the greeting went unanswered. That makes the
 * launch turn simultaneously plumbing and a real user message, and the two
 * have to be separated rather than the whole turn dropped. Hiding it wholesale
 * opens every conversation with a reply to an invisible question.
