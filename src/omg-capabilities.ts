/**
 * The launch envelope for a bot's backing session.
 *
 * `awaitingFirstMessage` decides the closing rule, and it is not cosmetic. A
 * bot session is launched by the first message that needs it, so that message
 * rides along in the very same prompt. Telling the model "do not reply to this
 * setup" unconditionally made it swallow that first message — the greeting got
 * no answer and only the second message ever worked. So the silence rule is
 * only correct when nothing is bundled; when a message is attached, the
 * contract has to point at it explicitly.
 *
 * The turn-shape rules exist because a bot runs on the ordinary coding-agent
 * harness: same tools, same skills, same box, `bypassPermissions`, no per-turn
 * budget. Identity and a "do not ship" line were never enough to make that
 * behave like a conversation. Asked "how is our bot system doing?", a bot spent
 * four minutes on 25+ tool calls — it picked up an unrelated status skill, went
 * SSH'ing into two production hosts, read the customer database and the
 * analytics store, and still had not said a word to the human. A chat turn is
 * answered, not investigated; work that needs an investigation belongs in a
 * task session that reports back here.
 *
 * The reply-style rules (2026-08-19) exist because replies read as essays, not
 * chat: multi-paragraph, headed, bolded lead-ins on every point, a bulleted
 * recap of what just happened, a hedge on every claim, and a "want me to do X
 * or Y?" tacked onto the end regardless of whether the question called for it.
 * The fix is not a new tool. Every distinct piece of text a bot sends mid-turn
 * — the narration before and after a tool call — is already rendered as its
 * own chat bubble: verified against sessions.ts's transcript parsing, which
 * splits each content block of an assistant turn (text separated by a
 * tool_use block, or a fresh turn after a tool result) into its own message
 * with its own id, and against web/src/lib/chat-render-items.ts, which never
 * coalesces separate text messages back into one bubble. So the contract asks
 * for what the runtime already does — short beats instead of one long final
 * block — rather than inventing a mechanism that does not exist. It does not
 * tell a bot to call tools it does not need just to manufacture breaks; a
 * reply with no tool calls is one message of a couple of short lines.
