/**
 * Who wrote a stored turn.
 *
 * `verified` means SERVER-RESOLVED, not cryptographically vouched, and the
 * name is a historical overclaim worth reading carefully before relying on it.
 * It is true whenever the box was able to name the sender at all. How much
 * that is worth depends entirely on how the box is reached:
 *
 *   - Through a hosted Computer, the address came from control-plane's
 *     HMAC-signed grant, checked against the share row, forwarded on a fixed
 *     header whitelist. A browser cannot put it there.
 *   - Directly on a self-hosted box, it came from an address the caller
 *     declared, validated against the configured roster. That names an
 *     existing member rather than a stranger, but the box's `/api/*` has no
 *     auth token and never has (see bots/access.ts), so it is exactly as
 *     trustworthy as every other header on that API — which is to say the box
 *     already trusts whoever can reach it.
 *
 * Both are attribution, and neither is authorization. Nothing anywhere should
 * read this field as a permission check.
 *
 * `false` is the honest unknown: no marker, no recorded send, or an author the
 * box could not resolve to an address. The client renders those unattributed
 * rather than guessing (see isOtherHumanMessageAuthor).
 *
 * FOLLOW-UP: rename to `source: "managed" | "box" | "unknown"`, which says
 * this in the type instead of in a comment. Deliberately not done in the same
 * change as the behaviour, because it alters a persisted discriminant that
 * older cached bundles still read, and that migration deserves its own review.
