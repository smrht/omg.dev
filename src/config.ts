 * The OMG MCP registration for one specific session, for the Claude Agent SDK's

 *
 * MCP is served by the shared `omg serve` process rather than a child of each
 * agent (see src/mcp-http.ts), so the endpoint cannot read the caller's identity
 * out of its own environment the way a stdio child could — the caller has to
 * name itself in the URL. A user-scope registration can't: one config file
 * serves every session on the box. So each session re-registers the same
 * endpoint under its own `?session=` URL at launch.
 *
 * The key is the tool namespace the agent sees (`mcp__omg__omg_ship`). It was
 * `lfg` before the rename; sessions already running keep whatever they
 * registered with, and their `lfg_*` calls are aliased at the wire in mcp.ts.
 *
 * Returns nothing outside a managed session, leaving the user-scope
 * registration in charge.
