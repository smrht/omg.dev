// A Shipped post claims a verified result. For LFG's own repo,

// ship otherwise — but that gate only fires when the session's repoRoot IS
// this repo. Sessions in every other project (vibes, whatsapp-bot, ...) shipped
// with no source-control check at all, so "shipped" and "landed on main" drifted
// apart silently and a reader had no way to tell which posts carried code.
//
// This reads what Git actually says about the session worktree at ship time,
// stores it on the post for tracing, and refuses the ship outright when the
// work is uncommitted or has not reached main. A post that has to be read
// sceptically is worth very little: the feed is only useful if "shipped" means
// the code is in. Sessions with no code to show (ops, research, a deploy, a
// plain conversation) still ship freely — the gate fires on work that exists
// and did not land, never on work that was never there.
