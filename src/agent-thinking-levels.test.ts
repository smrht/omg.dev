// Each agent must only be offered thinking levels its own CLI accepts.
//
// The two failure modes are different and neither is obvious from the code:
//
//   grok: --effort/--reasoning-effort: unknown effort level 'xhigh'; use one of: high, medium, low
//         → a hard exit, so the session never starts
//   pi:   Warning: Invalid thinking level "max". Valid values: off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh
//         → a warning, so the session runs and the setting silently never applies
//
// Both were reachable from the picker, which offered every agent the Claude
// list. These assert the property rather than the tables, so a level added to
// the shared vocabulary later can't reintroduce it by being forgotten here.
