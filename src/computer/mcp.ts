// The omg.dev Computer MCP — a LOCAL, separate MCP server for the desktop.
//
// Deliberately NOT part of the omg MCP in src/commands/mcp.ts. That catalog is
// the hosted product's contract and ships to cloud sessions, where there is no
// X display, no x11vnc and no Chrome to drive; adding desktop tools there would
// advertise capabilities most sessions cannot use and pay for their schemas in
// every context window. The Computer is a property of THIS box, so it gets its
// own server that an operator attaches only where a desktop actually exists.
//
// Tool names are `computer_*`, not `omg_*`. The omg server rewrites inbound
// `lfg_*` to `omg_*` at the wire boundary, and a separate prefix keeps the two
// catalogs from ever colliding if both are attached to one agent.
//
// Every tool goes through the local serve process over HTTP rather than
// importing desktop.ts directly. This is the important structural choice: the
// desktop's lifecycle state is a module singleton owned by serve, so a tool
// that imported it here (a separate stdio process) would start a SECOND desktop
// on the same display and ports, and neither process would see the other's.
// One owner, reached over the same API the web UI uses.

const COMPUTER_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS = `This server controls the Computer: one shared desktop on this machine, with a real browser running on it.

The desktop is shared, not per-session. A person may be watching it in the omg.dev Computer tab while you work, and they see exactly what you do -- your browsing happens in a visible window on their screen. Call computer_status first; if it is not running, call computer_start.

Browser actions act on one visible tab. Prefer computer_click with a CSS selector over raw coordinates: the selector form waits for the element to be attached, visible, stable and unobscured, while coordinates are a guess about layout. Use computer_read to see page text and computer_screenshot when you need to look at the page. When a person wants to point at an element, call computer_inspect and wait for their click.`;
