// The Computer: one shared desktop this box owns, and the browser that runs on
// it.
//
// This is deliberately ONE desktop, not one per session. The Settings UI already
// calls this box "the Computer", and a person has one screen, one mouse and one
// keyboard, so a display per session would mostly mean displays nobody watches.
//
// There is deliberately no input lock. Agents drive the browser over CDP, into
// a specific tab; a person drives over RFB, at the X level. Those are separate
// channels, so a desktop-wide lock would mostly block the person from their own
// machine. The contention that IS real is agents sharing one browser tab (see
// browser.ts), and the fix for that is a tab per session rather than a mutex
// over the whole screen.
//
// The stack, bottom to top:
//   Xvfb     a virtual X display with no physical screen
//   openbox  a window manager, so windows have decorations and focus
//   x11vnc   exposes that display over RFB on 127.0.0.1 (never the network)
//   chrome   HEADFUL on the display, with remote debugging for the agent
//
// Chrome is headful on purpose. Headless Chrome announces itself in the user
// agent ("HeadlessChrome") and is trivially fingerprinted; headful-under-Xvfb
// is a real browser that happens to have no monitor. Bun.WebView cannot give us
// this by itself -- it spawns headless and throws on `headless: false` -- so we
// launch Chrome ourselves and let Bun.WebView ATTACH over the DevTools socket.
// See browser.ts.
//
// Nothing here is installed by `omg setup`. Chrome is ~134 MB and the X stack a
// few MB more, and v0.1.321 removed the last browser feature precisely because
// every install paid for something most people never ran. `ensureDeps()` reports
// what is missing and the command that fixes it, and the desktop only starts
// when someone asks for it.
