// lfg connect — generic remote-access relay client.
//
// Lets a self-hosted `lfg serve` box be reached through a WebSocket relay
// instead of exposing an inbound port. Deliberately provider-agnostic: this
// file must never hardcode a specific relay's URL, branding, or account
// model — LFG_RELAY_URL is a required argument, not a default, so any
// operator can point it at their own relay implementation. (omg's dashboard
// supplies its own relay URL as the *value* of that env var — see
// apps/imsg/BYO_COMPUTER.md in the vibes repo for that integration; nothing
// omg-specific belongs in this file.)
//
// `lfg serve`'s own HTTP API has no application-layer auth (see
// live-ws.ts's liveWsUpgradeAuthenticated) — it always trusted its network
// perimeter (localhost bind, or whatever put it there). A relay is a new
// perimeter, so this client authenticates to the RELAY (pairing code once,
// then a persisted bearer token) — it does not change `serve` itself.
//
// Wire protocol (frames over one WebSocket to LFG_RELAY_URL):
//   client → relay   {type:"pair", code, computerUrl?, caps}  (first connect only)
//   relay  → client   {type:"paired", token, boxId, caps?}     (persist token; reconnect with it instead of a code)
//   client → relay   {type:"hello", token, computerUrl?, caps} (subsequent connects)
//   relay  → client   {type:"hello-ok", caps?}                 (optional; unknown frame types are ignored anyway)
//
// CAPABILITY NEGOTIATION. `caps` is this build's wire features (see
// src/relay-frames.ts); the relay answers with the subset it also speaks, and
// that intersection governs the connection. Both omissions are meaningful and
// both must keep working: a relay predating negotiation answers with no `caps`
// and gets the JSON-only protocol below, and a box predating it advertises
// none, so a new relay serves it the same way. Never make a cap the default.
//
//   binary       payload frames are [4B BE header length][JSON header][bytes]
//                instead of base64 inside the JSON. Applies to ws-msg,
//                stream-data and http-body.
//   http-stream  a response comes back as http-head → http-body* → http-end
//                rather than one buffered http-response:
//                  client → relay  {type:"http-head", id, status, headers}
//                  client → relay  {type:"http-body", id} + raw bytes
//                  client → relay  {type:"http-end",  id, error?}
//                Without it, a response body has to fit in ONE frame after a
//                4/3 base64 inflation. That is not a soft limit — the relay's
//                WebSocket server closes the connection on an oversized frame,
//                so a single large artifact took the whole box offline.
//   relay  → client   {type:"error", message}                  (pairing/hello rejected — relay closes right after)
//   relay  → client   {type:"http", id, method, path, headers, bodyB64?}
//   client → relay   {type:"http-response", id, status, headers, bodyB64?}
//   client → relay   {type:"event", event, sessionId, title?, project?, agent?, ts, …}
//                     (opt-in, LFG_CONNECT_EVENTS=1 — see "Session lifecycle
//                     events" below; no response frame, a relay that doesn't
//                     understand `event` just ignores or errors it and this
//                     client doesn't care either way. Every event kind shares
//                     that envelope and only ADDS fields — ship.posted adds
//                     summary/media, auto.finding adds
//                     findingId/severity/reasoning/suggest, auto.question adds
//                     questionId/question/options — so a relay that forwards
//                     `event` frames verbatim needs no change to carry a new
//                     kind.)
//   relay  → client   {type:"ws-open",  id, path}               (open a tunnel onto local serve's WebSocket)
//   client → relay    {type:"ws-ack",   id, ok, error?}
//   either → other    {type:"ws-msg",   id, dataB64, binary}
//   either → other    {type:"ws-close", id, code?, reason?}
//   relay  → client   {type:"stream-open",  id, path}           (open a STREAMING http tunnel — SSE, e.g. /api/live/stream)
//   client → relay    {type:"stream-head",  id, status, headers}
//   client → relay    {type:"stream-data",  id, dataB64}
//   either → other    {type:"stream-close", id, error?}
//   either → other    {type:"ping"} / {type:"pong"}
//
// This is intentionally the smallest surface that lets a relay reverse-proxy
// HTTP semantics onto a box with no inbound port open. Ordinary requests use
// the buffered http/http-response pair; the ws-* frames add a real duplex
// tunnel, because a live channel (serve.ts's /api/live/ws) genuinely cannot be
// expressed as one request/response. That tunnel is what lets a PUBLIC origin
// render a session hosted on this box at all: a tailnet box resolves to a
// private 100.x address, and a browser on a public origin is forbidden from
// loading it (Chrome Private Network Access), so the bytes have to come back
// over this outbound socket rather than a direct connection. An `error`
// frame during `hello` means the saved token is no longer valid (expired,
// revoked, or unknown to the relay) — that will never resolve by retrying,
// so the reconnect loop below treats it as fatal rather than backing off
// forever against a token that can't work.
//
// Session lifecycle events (opt-in, LFG_CONNECT_EVENTS=1):
//
// When enabled, this client also polls its own local `lfg serve` (the same
// GET /api/sessions any client of this box's HTTP API can call — see
// src/sessions.ts's Session type) every LFG_CONNECT_EVENTS_INTERVAL_MS (default
// 4000ms) and diffs busy/status transitions per session. Two transitions are
// reported as `event` frames up the relay socket, whenever a live connection
// is open:
//   - a session that was busy goes idle without being blocked → "session.completed"
//   - a session's status flips to "blocked" (see computeStatus in
//     src/sessions.ts — model unavailable, out of credits, provider auth/error)
//     → "session.needs_attention"
// The very first poll after connecting only seeds a baseline (no events) so a
// box that's had long-finished sessions sitting around doesn't fire a burst of
// stale notifications on startup.
//
// Autonomous-agent events (same flag, same cadence, same first-poll seeding):
//
//   - "auto.finding" — a new finding produced by an auto agent (src/auto/*,
//     read off GET /api/auto/findings?status=open). Auto agents run headless on
//     a schedule; without this, their output only exists in this box's web UI
//     and nobody hears about it until they open it. The frame carries the
//     finding's title, severity, a capped slice of its reasoning, and its
//     suggested next step, which is enough for a gateway to render something
//     actionable without a second round-trip.
//   - "auto.question" — an OPEN ask-user question (src/ask/*, read off
//     GET /api/ask?status=open). An agent that needs a human decision parks a
//     question here and ends its turn; the question sits open until somebody
//     answers. Forwarding it lets a connected chat channel BE that somebody.
//
// The answer-back path needs nothing new in this file. A gateway that received
// an auto.question answers it by proxying an ordinary HTTP request back down
// the relay's request plane — the relay sends `{type:"http", …}` for
// `POST /api/ask/<id>/answer`, forwardToLocalServe hands it to local serve, and
// serve resolves the question (and, for a pushback ask, pushes the reply into
// the asking session as a new user message). In other words the outbound event
// and the inbound answer travel over the two planes this protocol already has;
// `event` frames stay strictly one-way and response-free.
//
// This intentionally polls locally rather than opening a second WebSocket to
// this box's own `/api/live/ws` status channel: `lfg connect` runs as a
// separate process from `lfg serve` (its only access to this box is the same
// HTTP surface a remote client would use), and a plain interval against
// GET /api/sessions is far simpler to reason about and test than a second
// long-lived socket with its own reconnect/heartbeat state machine. The
// resulting latency (bounded by the poll interval, a few seconds at most, and
// entirely on loopback) is negligible next to what it replaces — this box
// announcing a completion is still categorically faster than a remote poller
// checking in every few seconds over the network.
//
// Not every transition is forwarded, even with the flag on — two sanity
// defaults any relay operator gets for free, applied client-side before a
// frame is ever built:
//   - top-level only: a session with a parentSessionId (a subagent, spawned
//     via `lfg subagent` — see src/commands/subagent.ts) never generates a
//     frame. Subagent churn is routine and constant on a box running any
//     nontrivial agent workflow; forwarding it would mean every internal
//     step of someone else's task looks like a top-level notification.
//   - a minimum duration floor (MIN_REPORTABLE_DURATION_MS, default 60s):
//     a session.completed for a session that started and finished inside a
//     minute isn't news — quick blips (a one-line question, a trivial
//     lookup) shouldn't page anyone. session.needs_attention is exempt from
//     this floor: a session going "blocked" is actionable no matter how
//     young it is, unlike routine completion.
// See isTopLevelSession/isReportableTransition below.
//
// PRIVACY NOTE: when enabled, session titles (and project/agent names, ship
// titles/summaries, auto-agent finding titles/reasoning, and the full text of
// open ask-user questions) leave
// this box and are sent to whatever relay LFG_RELAY_URL points at, which then
// (per that relay's own policy) may forward them further (e.g. omg's relay
// forwards to an operator-configured webhook — see BYO_COMPUTER.md in the
// vibes repo). A session title is derived from your own first prompt in that
// session (see firstPromptTitle in src/sessions.ts) and can contain whatever
// you typed. This is why the flag defaults OFF — turning it on is an explicit
// choice to let a completion/attention signal (and the small amount of
// context needed to make it useful) leave the box. The top-level/60s filter
// above narrows WHICH transitions can trigger that, but doesn't change what
// leaves the box once one does.

const HELP = `lfg connect — pair this box to a remote-access relay (EXPERIMENTAL)

                           Redeem a one-time pairing code and advertise the URL where this UI is reachable
  lfg connect [--url <public-url>]
                           Resume the saved binding (and optionally update its advertised URL), e.g. from a
                           process manager after a restart); shows this help if never paired
  lfg connect status       Show the current relay binding, if any
  lfg connect disconnect   Drop the saved binding and stop
  lfg connect --foreground Keep the relay in this terminal instead of handing it to lfg serve
  lfg connect help         Show this help

Env:
  LFG_RELAY_URL              Relay WebSocket URL when --relay is omitted (no default)
  LFG_PUBLIC_URL             Same value as --url; an absolute HTTP(S) root for this computer's web UI
  LFG_PORT / LFG_HOST        Local 'lfg serve' address to proxy requests to (default 127.0.0.1:8766)
  LFG_CONNECT_EVENTS         Opt-in (1/true/yes, default off): forward session completed/needs-attention
                             events, shipped-post events, new auto-agent findings, and open ask-user
                             questions to the relay. PRIVACY: session titles, ship titles/summaries,
                             finding titles/reasoning, and question text leave this box when on.
  LFG_CONNECT_EVENTS_INTERVAL_MS  Local session-poll interval in ms when events are enabled (default 4000)
  LFG_CONNECT_EVENTS_MIN_DURATION_MS  Minimum session duration to report a completion, in ms (default 60000).
                             Does not apply to session.needs_attention (always reported).

No relay implementation ships with LFG. This is the generic client half of a
protocol any relay operator can implement — see the wire protocol documented
at the top of src/commands/connect.ts.
