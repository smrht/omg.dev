// The scheduler's bot-owned dispatch branch (docs/bot-owned-automations-plan.md
// §2b/§2d): a bot-owned row is delivered through the injected
// setBotRoutineDelivery hook, fire-and-forget, and must NEVER fall through to
// the headless runAutoAgent path. lastRunAt is stamped before dispatch either
// way, so a missing/disabled bot (or any delivery failure) doesn't retry every
// tick for the ~25h catch-up window.
//
// Deliberately uses ONLY bot-owned rows in every test here: a headless
// (user-owned) row due in the same tick would call the REAL runAutoAgent,
// which spins up an actual coding-agent session — not something a unit test
// should risk triggering. The "never falls through to runAutoAgent" guarantee
// is instead pinned with a source-text check, same spirit as the existing
// truncateAutoAgentPrompt/withAutoAgentListMeta wiring guards in
// test/auto-agent-list-payload.test.ts.
