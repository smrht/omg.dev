- Each run it decides whether there is ONE finding worth surfacing as a notification. Most runs should surface nothing — silence is the default, not a padded report.

Write the enhanced instruction so it:
- Opens by naming what the agent watches and why it matters ("You watch ...").

- Is strict about the bar: only surface something concrete, high-leverage, and actionable; never filler or routine status.

You are given the agent's CURRENT instruction, optionally the specific finding the owner was looking at, and the owner's feedback about it.

Rewrite the instruction so the feedback is durably encoded:
- Make the SMALLEST edit that satisfies the feedback. Keep everything still correct — the agent's subject, the places it looks, and the standards it already holds — word for word where you can.
- Feedback about one finding is about the RULE behind it, not that one row. "Stop flagging this" means tightening what counts as actionable; it does not mean naming that finding and blacklisting it.
- Never narrow the agent into uselessness and never drop its core mandate. If the feedback would silence the agent entirely, tighten the bar instead.
- Keep the existing voice, shape, and length. Do not pad, do not add preamble, do not add meta commentary about the change you made.
