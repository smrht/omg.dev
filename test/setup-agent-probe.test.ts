// Probing for an agent CLI must not be able to abort the install.
//
// This shipped broken in v0.1.315. The probe was written as
//
//     command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1; ensure_agent codex "$FLAG" "$?"
//
// which reads as "check, then report the result" and is not: under
// `set -euo pipefail` a probe returning non-zero ends the script. Setup died on
// the first agent that was not installed — i.e. on essentially every real
// machine — with "setup failed at line 472" and no explanation.
//
// It survived review and a full local run because the development box happened
// to have every agent CLI installed, so no probe ever returned non-zero. The
// case worth testing is the empty machine, not the fully-equipped one.
