// Switching a launch surface to a backend with no reasoning knob must DROP the
// thinking level, not carry it over.
//
// Two independent spots resurrected a level the new backend can't take, and
// both surfaced as the same 400 on the home screen:
//
//   thinkingLevel is not supported for opencode sessions
//
//   1. saveAutoAgent merged `input.thinkingLevel ?? existing.thinkingLevel`.
//      The editor correctly omits the level for opencode, so the merge put the
//      level the agent held as claude straight back and persisted a record that
//      no longer validates. Nothing re-checks a stored row, so it only broke
//      later, at launch.
//   2. replyToFinding (graduating a finding into a session) sent
//      `opts.thinkingLevel ?? sourceAgent.thinkingLevel` while sending the
//      OVERRIDDEN agent — so picking opencode in the finding sheet, which sends
//      no level by design, inherited the source auto agent's level anyway.
//
// These assert the property (level is always valid for the backend that runs
// it), so a third surface can't reintroduce it.
