  omg help

This command installs the local omg.dev agent control plane. After setup,
open http://localhost:8766.

You bring your own agent accounts. omg.dev does not resell tokens.

After setup, unknown commands are forwarded to the install. \`lfg\` remains
a compatibility alias for that install.

create / deploy / login run on the installed runtime. They no longer download
the retired 0.4.42 CLI.
