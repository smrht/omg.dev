# Changelog

Recent product updates and deployment notes.

## September 25, 2026 - Session titles that name the task (v0.6.127)

- New sessions get a title that says what the task is. Before, the title model sometimes did the task instead, and a session could be titled with an invented error message or with the model's own instructions.
- On phones, the queued-message card under the composer is inset from the edges again.
- A running tool no longer shows typing dots under it, and live "Worked" rows no longer show a dot.

## September 25, 2026 - One layout per screen size (v0.6.126)

- The web app now has only a phone layout and a desktop layout. Windows between 768 and 1023 pixels wide get the desktop sidebar instead of a mixed layout.
- The desktop sidebar is cleaner. The stray dividers are gone, and the icons and titles line up.
- Live replies appear a paragraph at a time on the web and in the iPhone app, instead of word by word.
- Finished tool rows in a conversation show only their label and end in a chevron. The pulsing dot shows only while a tool runs.
- On iPhone, a notification shows the mark of the agent that sent it.
- On iPhone, press and hold a video to save or share it. The caption under each video is gone.

## September 24, 2026 - Faster return connections (v0.6.124)

- Returning to a screen can reuse a valid connection grant. Network failures and explicit reconnects still refresh the relay route.
- Mobile clients can request a small readiness response without downloading the full web bootstrap payload.
- iOS connection startup runs readiness and live updates in parallel. Connection latency and timing details are available in Settings under Debug.

## September 24, 2026 - Connectors that just work (v0.6.123)

- Connectors now list only apps omg has tested: Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar and Google Sheets. Each runs on omg's own tools, and the untested catalog is gone.
- Pick who a connection is for with tabs (you, a role, or the whole team). A connection given to a role works for that role's agents with no tool rules, and open sessions pick up new tools without a restart.
- The iPhone app has Settings › Connectors: connect an app for the whole team from your phone.
- On a hosted Computer, Google apps connect with no setup: omg.dev's own Google sign-in is built in.
- Google asks for fewer permissions: Calendar asks for 2 instead of 12, and Gmail asks for 1.

## September 24, 2026 - Nearby Bridge relays (v0.6.122)

- Bridges can choose the fastest healthy relay region and reconnect through another region without pairing again.
- Hosted clients use the Bridge region for live updates, requests, uploads, and media when the server supplies a regional route.

## September 24, 2026 - Long videos keep playing (v0.6.121)

- A video from a hosted computer no longer stops after a few minutes. When its access link expires, the player gets a new one and continues from the same point. This works on the web and in the iPhone app.

## September 24, 2026 - Faster file downloads on iPhone (v0.6.120)

- On iPhone, Download on a file page is much faster for large files. The file goes straight to disk.
- The file page shows download progress: bytes done, total size, and percent.
- On a phone browser, a file, image or video opened from a session now shows on top of the session, not behind it.

## September 24, 2026 - One menu for the desktop sidebar (v0.6.119)

- The desktop sidebar has one menu button. It opens Chat, Bots, Schedules, Notifications, Artifacts, Computer, Board, Settings and your machine over the list, with Back to return. The Chat / Bots / Schedules tabs and the three-dot menu are gone.
- The top of the sidebar shows your welcome, what your agents are building, or who needs you. The omg.dev mark moves to the bottom.
- The folder picker sits next to New session and lists each folder's session count. Manage folders reorders, hides, removes or adds folders.
- Session and bot rows are shorter, so more of the list fits.
- Hover the edge of the sidebar to collapse or expand it.
- Open updates show as a list inside the sidebar.
- A Get the apps card at the bottom of the sidebar installs omg on your computer or opens the iPhone app with a QR code. It now shows on omg.dev too.
- The input bar no longer has a Stop button. Stop is in the session menu, and Esc still stops the agent.
- The machine switcher no longer shows an online dot.

## September 24, 2026 - Expo apps load real data in Expo Go (v0.6.118)

- An Expo app's agent now deploys the backend before the preview, makes it public, and points the app at it, so Expo Go shows real data from the first open. The agent tells you the backend is public until you add sign-in.
- The preview card now says when an Expo Go link has expired, and Restart preview asks the agent for a new one.
- An agent's `omg_deploy` now counts the upload inside its 45 second wait, so the call always answers before the tool times out.

## September 23, 2026 - Google Drive, and Upgrade in the phone menu (v0.6.117)

- Google Drive now works through omg's own connector, on the same Google sign-in as Gmail. Agents can search, read, create and trash files. Docs and Slides read as text, and Sheets read as CSV.
- When Google's consent screen left a permission unticked, Gmail and Drive now say how to fix it.
- A connection you give to a role, or to the whole team, now works for that role's agents. A running agent sees new connections without a restart.
- Your connections list shows your own, each role's and the team's connections, grouped by who can use them.
- On a phone, the home composer and the chat input sit 16px from the screen edge, as in the app.
- The phone navigation menu has a place for the host's own rows, above Settings. On omg.dev the Upgrade button moves there, so it no longer sits in the top bar.

## September 23, 2026 - Reliable agent deploys (v0.6.116)

- An agent's `omg_deploy` now answers within 45 seconds. A longer build returns `pending`, and the new `omg_deploy_status` tool waits for it. Agents no longer report a failed deploy for an app that went live.
- When you do not answer an agent's question in time, the agent asks again once in a normal chat message instead of repeating the question card.
- A new project on an older Computer gets a default git identity, so the agent's first commit works. Your own git identity always wins.
- When another project's Metro holds the preview port, the Expo preview script names the next port to use.

## September 23, 2026 - The app's list, on the web (v0.6.115)

- Gmail now works through omg's own connector. It searches, reads, sends, replies, drafts, labels and trashes mail directly with the Gmail API. Google's own Gmail server answers only for accounts in a Google preview programme, so Gmail never worked through it.
- The signed-in mailbox is shown in the Gmail connection name, so two Google accounts are told apart.
- The session list on the web now matches the app. Rows are taller, the agent mark is larger, and the title is larger. The title of an unread chat stays at full weight until you read it.
- The time a chat last moved is shown before its unread mark, as it is in the app.
- The web list opens on a folder. Before, it could open with no folder selected and nothing to say why.
- Open findings are behind an "Updates" pill, on the phone and in the sidebar. They were a list section at the end of the chats.
- The folder name above each group of chats is gone on the phone. The folder pills above the list say the same thing.
- The profile picture at the top right is larger, and it no longer sits on a grey plate.
- The model list no longer goes below the bottom of the screen. It fits the space under the composer and scrolls.
- The agent sheet no longer opens as an empty card after you close it and open it again.
- Expo previews name the next port to use when another project holds the one you asked for.
- Production builds for iOS use Xcode 26.6.

## September 23, 2026 - Expo Go links are limited to Metro ports (v0.6.114)

- Expo Go links now work only for a Metro port from 8081 to 8099. An Expo Go link skips the owner sign-in, so it must not open other services on your Computer. `omg_expose_port` explains the range when an agent picks another port.

## September 23, 2026 - Faster Expo previews that recover after sleep (v0.6.113)

- New Expo projects start their preview with one command, `bash scripts/start-expo-preview.sh`. It waits for Metro, builds the iOS and web bundles ahead of time so the first Expo Go open is fast, and checks the sandbox proxy.
- When a Computer sleeps and its preview stops, the preview card now says Stopped and offers Restart preview. The button asks the agent to start it again.
- App-building agents ask one question at a time and wait for you to say what the app should do.
- An OpenCode question no longer appears twice in the transcript.

## September 23, 2026 - One navigation on a phone (v0.6.112)

- The web app on a phone now has a side navigation. Chat, Bots, Schedules, Notifications, Artifacts, Computer, Board and Settings are all in it, and the bar at the bottom of the screen is gone.
- The navigation opens from the button at the top left. It starts with the computer you are working on, and that button shows whether the computer is online.
- The project rail no longer has an "All" pill. Press the selected folder again to see every folder.
- The agent sheet no longer draws a block below itself, and it now changes smoothly between the agent list and the model list.
- The iOS app's Coding agents settings have a Refresh models button. It asks your computer to read the model list from every provider again.
- On a phone, the web composer now works like the iOS composer. Tap the agent icon to open the agent sheet. It holds the agent, the model, Fast mode, and the thinking level. Long-press Claude to choose a Claude profile.
- The web composer on a phone is one row until you type. Then the text moves to its own line, and the controls move below it. It sends with a round arrow button, as on iOS.
- A new session now belongs to the profile that you selected. Before, it belonged to the person that the session list was filtered to.

## September 23, 2026 - Expo Go card and unstuck OpenCode answers (v0.6.111)

- An Expo preview card now offers Open in Expo Go. On iOS it shows setup steps with an App Store button, and on web it shows a QR code.
- An OpenCode session no longer stops when the iOS app answers its question with a chat message. The message now answers the open question.

## September 22, 2026 - Claude Opus 5.5 in the model picker

- Claude and Agent SDK sessions can select `claude-opus-5-5` by name. The `opus` alias also resolves to Opus 5.5.
- The full id needs Claude Code 2.1.280 or newer. An older CLI rejects it, so use the `opus` alias until you update.

## September 22, 2026 - Expo Go uses the sandbox proxy (v0.6.110)

- `omg_expose_port` now prepares a short-lived `exps://` link for Expo Go on any Metro port.
- Expo agents start one Metro server for web and device testing through the omg.dev sandbox proxy.
- New Expo projects no longer use Expo tunnel, `exp.direct`, ngrok, or LAN exposure.

## September 22, 2026 - Expo previews use the sandbox proxy first (v0.6.109)

- Expo Web agents now expose the development server's actual port through the omg.dev preview card before trying any other route.
- Expo tunnel stays a separate path for explicit native Expo Go device testing.

## September 22, 2026 - Live previews support any port (v0.6.108)

- `omg_expose_port` now accepts any valid TCP port from 1 through 65535.
- Agents can expose the port that an existing web or Expo server already uses instead of restarting it on port 5173.

## September 22, 2026 - App starters work on managed Computers (v0.6.107)

- App, Website, API, and Image starters now create their chat workspace in a user-owned data folder.
- A root-owned managed runtime folder no longer makes the starter fail with `cloud_runtime_unavailable`.

## September 22, 2026 - Reliable mobile and web UI checks (v0.6.106)

- The model picker now shows the xAI mark for Grok models.
- Mobile and web behavior checks now follow the current navigation, plan, archive, finding-page, and transcript behavior.
- Browser test state no longer leaks into later server tests. The full test suite passes again.

## September 22, 2026 - A useful Expo app from the first message (v0.6.105)

- New app projects start as a working todo app with Lucide icons and native Liquid Glass on supported iPhones.
- The todo list uses the omg.dev database. The same data works in the hosted Expo Web app and in Expo Go.
- The project skill now guides the agent through the web deploy, the Expo Go QR code, and the native API URL setup.
- Apple Sign In stays optional because it requires an Apple Developer account, an app identifier, and a native development build.
- Chats without a project are now in the web app, as they are on iOS. A plus tab leads the project rail. It scopes the list to chats with no folder, and an empty composer offers the Website, App, API, and Image starters.
- A project that the agent creates during one of those chats now appears in the web project list without a page reload.
- The Computer screenshot and read tools no longer fail when they run before anything opens a page.

## September 22, 2026 - The composer keeps the agent you chose (v0.6.104)

- The composer no longer replaces your selected agent when the agent list is still loading or is briefly incomplete. Your choice is restored as soon as that agent can run again.
- A substituted agent is never saved as your new choice. Before, one incorrect read of the agent list could pin a device to an agent that nobody selected.
- The opencode agent is now off by default. It stays a full agent, and one switch in Settings turns it on. Installing it from onboarding or from Settings also turns it on.
- A hosted Computer now offers the omg agent when no account is connected. Before, only the opencode agent was offered, and it came with a DeepSeek model.
- Your agent and model choice is now stored on the box. The choice follows you to a new phone, a reinstalled app, or a cleared browser.
- The Computer Use MCP is now on for each new session. The desktop tools reach the agent with no manual configuration. The Settings switch still turns the server off.

## September 22, 2026 - Managed Expo project starters (v0.6.103)

- New Expo projects can start from a versioned Expo Router template with Expo Web, a server API route, and EAS build profiles already configured.
- Expo Go device testing now uses a project-local tunnel dependency. A fresh Cloud Computer can show a QR code without installing a global tool.
- The project builder skill verifies Expo Web first, then offers the temporary Expo Go tunnel for real device testing.
- Website login requests and agent questions now appear as inline message cards with consistent corners.

## September 22, 2026 - Reliable hosted agent startup (v0.6.102)

- Hosted omg agents now allow enough time for the bundled MCP tools to start on a cold Computer.
- The opencode agent and the omg agent no longer stop to ask permission to edit a file, run a command, fetch a web page, or read an external directory. A headless session does not wait for an answer that nobody is there to give.
- The loop guard stays on. A tool call that repeats with the same input still asks before it continues.

## September 22, 2026 - Hosted omg agent tools (v0.6.101)

- DeepSeek Flash and other omg models now receive the omg.dev MCP tools in hosted sandboxes, including live port previews.

## September 22, 2026 - Headless Expo preview startup (v0.6.100)

- Expo Web previews no longer try to open a desktop browser inside a headless Cloud Computer.

## September 22, 2026 - Live sandbox project previews (v0.6.99)

- Agents can now expose a live web or Expo Web server from a Cloud Computer as a private preview card in the session.
- The card opens inside the web app or iOS app, and it also offers an external browser action.
- New project skills use the portable local Expo dependency and do not depend on Xcode, a simulator, SSH hosts, or omg.dev repository paths.

## September 21, 2026 - Current website login request (v0.6.98)

- Website login cards now select the newest request by creation time. An older failed transfer can no longer hide a newer pending login request when the server returns them out of order.

## September 21, 2026 - Portable Expo project delivery (v0.6.97)

- New Expo projects now target a verified hosted web preview first and offer an Expo Go tunnel QR code for physical-device testing.
- The app-builder skill no longer requires a local iOS simulator, Xcode, or a Mac. Development builds and TestFlight remain optional user-authorized delivery paths.

## September 21, 2026 - Grok 4.7 in the model picker

- Grok, Cursor, fx, Copilot, and the omg agent can now launch Grok 4.7. New Grok sessions use it by default.
- Grok 4.7 Fast is in the Grok picker as `grok-4.7-build-fast`.
- Grok 4.7 and 4.6 accept Extra High thinking. Grok 4.5 still stops at High.

## September 21, 2026 - Focused iOS artifact list

- The iOS Artifacts page now matches the web: only HTML artifacts appear. Images, videos, and other files stay in their chats.
- Open chat is now a small text link below the artifact card.

## September 21, 2026 - Direct iPhone keyboard control (v0.6.96)

- The iPhone keyboard now types directly into the remote Computer. Every key is sent immediately, with no compose field or Send button.
- The live desktop stays visible above the keyboard. A compact floating control pill replaces the large control panel and adds Escape, Tab, modifiers, arrows, right click, and keyboard dismissal.


## September 21, 2026 - All artifacts in the iOS side menu (v0.6.95)

- Open Artifacts from the iOS side menu to see output from all chats on the selected Computer. Each item links back to its source chat.
- The compact Live Activity shows each agent icon once. Multiple sessions using the same agent keep their full session count.

## September 21, 2026 - Control the Computer from iPhone (v0.6.94)

- iOS can open the selected Computer, watch its live desktop, and take control with a touch trackpad.
- The control screen includes a software keyboard, text paste, Return, Tab, Escape, Backspace, and right click. It starts in view-only mode to prevent accidental input.

## September 21, 2026 - Faster chat opening and saved Home

- iOS: starting a conversation opens the real chat screen at once. The prompt is its first message and the reply lands in the same screen. The separate "Starting conversation" page is gone.
- iOS: Home draws its saved sessions as the same screen it becomes once your computer answers. The folder pills stay, the rows stay grouped by folder, and no banner announces that the list is saved. The top bar reads "Reconnecting" until the computer answers, in the normal label colour.
- iOS: the Settings software row updates the computer as well as naming its version. The button reads Update when a release is available and Restart when the update is already on disk. An update restarts the computer service; it does not stop running sessions.

## September 21, 2026 - Reliable New Project skill handoff (v0.6.93)

- App and Website presets now name `.agents/skills/omg-app-builder/SKILL.md` directly, so the agent reads the correct workflow before it builds.
- Selecting an existing folder installs the current app-builder skill before the session starts. Existing instructions, files, and Git history remain unchanged.
- iOS Settings now shows the connected computer version and uses native grouped lists.

## September 21, 2026 - iOS session artifacts (v0.6.92)

- iOS: Open Artifacts from a session menu to browse its images, videos, files, and HTML output.
- Interactive HTML artifacts now open inside the app with reload and retry controls. HTML follows the app theme and runs in an isolated frame.
- The HTML viewer needs the new native iOS build. Older binaries show an update message.

## September 21, 2026 - App-builder skills for New Project (v0.6.91)

- New projects and Quick Chats receive one reusable `omg-app-builder` skill for setup, implementation, verification, and delivery. Future project sessions inherit the same workflow from Git.
- The Website preset now produces a verified omg.dev deployment instead of a temporary HTML artifact. The iOS preset separates simulator proof, hosted deployment, and optional App Store delivery.
- Agent instructions remain in the project repository but are excluded from the deployed app bundle.

## September 21, 2026 - Stable Quick Chat starters (v0.6.90)

- iOS: Quick Chat starter cards stay visible on the plus tab before and during keyboard focus. The row no longer runs a competing reveal animation, and both scroll edges include space for the end cards.

## September 21, 2026 - Detailed Quick Chat starters (v0.6.89)

- iOS: Quick Chat starter cards use moderate corners instead of capsules. Each card now has an icon and a short description, while the row keeps its horizontal scrolling and keyboard focus.

## September 21, 2026 - Smoother Quick Chat starters (v0.6.88)

- iOS: the Quick Chat starter row fades in without adding a second layout jump as the keyboard opens. Its wider, rounder cards scroll horizontally within the composer margins and keep the keyboard open.

## September 21, 2026 - Reliable iPhone cookie imports

- Website login transfers preserve cookies that iOS reports with an incompatible SameSite value. Chrome now confirms that every cookie was retained before reporting a successful transfer.
- A successful cookie transfer still requires the agent to check the signed-in page.

## September 21, 2026 - Quick Chat and project creation (v0.6.87)

- iOS: the plus tab holds chats without a selected project. Start with the normal composer or choose a Website, App, API, or Image starter.
- Quick Chat agents can create a project folder for future chats. New web projects get guidance for omg.dev hosting, backend setup, live verification, and delivery of a preview link.
- The original chat stays in the plus tab. New projects appear when you return to Home.

## September 21, 2026 - Website login cards (v0.6.86)

- iOS login requests show the website icon and domain, with a clear “Log in to [website]” button. Sites without a usable icon show a domain initial.
- The web handoff text matches the updated mobile card. This update works with iOS app 1.0.12 (55).

## September 21, 2026 - Rounder question card and drawer

- iOS: the session question card, its answer chips, and the bottom drawer use the same 32pt continuous corners as the expanded composer. The question card was 12pt. Answer chips were pills. The agent picker drawer was 22pt.

## September 21, 2026 - Website login from iPhone (v0.6.85)

- Agents can request a website login in chat. The iOS app opens a private browser sheet. You choose when to transfer that website's login to the shared Computer browser.
- The agent gets a transfer result and must check the signed-in page. Login requests expire and can be cancelled. Other clients can use the web Computer view.
- The native login sheet requires iOS app 1.0.12 or later. It cannot be added to an older binary by an over-the-air update.

## September 21, 2026 - Mobile web trackpad stays responsive (v0.6.84)

- The Computer trackpad releases mouse capture after a tap. The next finger gesture can move the cursor without an extra click.

## September 20, 2026 - OpenCode starts on a new account (v0.6.83)

- OpenCode no longer fails on the first session of a new account with "CREATE TABLE workspace ... already exists". OpenCode migrates its database on every command with no lock, and the first session raced the agent status probe. Setup now migrates the database once, before any session or probe can start. Hosted Computers get the same fix from template v235.
- iOS: a conversation opens immediately. The session preview is kept, so the screen does not wait for the transcript before it shows the session.

## September 20, 2026 - Thinking levels for omg models (v0.6.82)

- The omg agent now offers a thinking level (low, medium, high) on models where the hosted router honours it: DeepSeek, Z.ai, Anthropic and OpenAI. Qwen3.7 Plus, MiniMax M3 and Qwen3 Coder Next show no selector because the router has no control for them. Web and iOS.
- iOS: the agent picker sheet keeps one height. The expanded tray made the model list hard to scroll.

## September 20, 2026 - Session names that describe the session (v0.6.81)

- A session name is now written from three turns: the first request, the most recent request, and the most recent reply. Before, only the first message was read. A session continued from another one was named after the continue instruction, so it read "Review auto-rename feature status" instead of naming the work.
- Settings > More > View has a new choice, "Name sessions with AI". "On" names a new session and keeps Rename with AI. "Manual" only names a session when you pick Rename with AI, so nothing is sent while a session starts. "Off" turns both off and hides the menu row on web and iOS.
- A self-hosted Computer now names a new session when it starts. This worked only on a hosted Computer before.
- Text that looks like a key, a token, a password, or a private key is removed before a name is requested. Tool output is never read for a name.

## September 20, 2026 - Faster mobile sessions (v0.6.81)

- Streaming replies reuse completed transcript rows, which reduces work while you read or scroll.
- Home mounts a window of session rows and pauses activity animations outside the visible area.
- Sessions open on a smaller recent section. Previously loaded messages appear from the memory cache while the app refreshes them. Scrolling up reveals cached history before fetching more.

## September 20, 2026 - Short omg model names, provider marks, free-plan credit (v0.6.80)

- The omg agent's model picker shows a short name with the provider's mark: "DeepSeek V4 Flash", "GLM 5.2", "GPT-5.6 Sol". The router id (`omg/deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`) stays the value and still matches the filter. Web and iOS (delivered by OTA).
- The omg usage ring now shows the free plan's signup credit. It was blank there because the free plan has no monthly window. Web usage page and the iOS usage sheet.


## September 19, 2026 - Smoother native loading animations (iOS 1.0.11)

- Working sessions use a native Skia grid and one title pulse. Five sessions with three active animations improved from 22.5 to 59.6 UI callbacks per second in the simulator benchmark.
- This change needs the new iOS binary. It cannot be delivered by an OTA alone.

## September 19, 2026 - Update install recovers from a frozen lockfile (v0.6.79)

- `omg update` still finishes when the Computer's Bun rejects the release lockfile. It drops that lockfile and installs from package.json.

## September 19, 2026 - Cloud verbs on an updated Computer (v0.6.78)

- `omg update` now ships the Cloud client with the release. `omg whoami` and `omg deploy` run on a Computer after that update.

## September 19, 2026 - Agents decide when to publish (v0.6.77)

- Publishing a project folder is an agent action (`omg deploy` / `omg_deploy`). The web project sheet and the iOS Folders sheet no longer have a Deploy button.

## September 19, 2026 - A switch to turn auto-update off (v0.6.76)

- Settings > System > Updates now has a switch on a release install. Off stops the background download. Check and Update still work. `LFG_AUTO_UPDATE=0` still disables it from the environment.

## September 19, 2026 - Updates wait for a restart (v0.6.75)

- A new release is downloaded in the background. The running process stays up. Restart when you want it, or wait for the next service start. Settings and the What's new drawer say Restart.

## September 18, 2026 - Local installs update themselves (v0.6.74)

- A computer installed with `omg computer setup` now applies a newer GitHub release on start, and checks again every 6 hours. The Update button still works. Skip still skips that version.
- Hosted Computers stay on the template version. A source checkout (a git pull install) stays manual. Set `LFG_AUTO_UPDATE=0` to turn the checker off.

## September 18, 2026 - Deploy a project from the client (v0.6.73)

- Web and iOS can publish a project folder to `*.omgs.app`. Open the project or folder sheet and use Deploy. The same URL stays on the row after a republish.
- `omg deploy`, `omg apps`, `omg whoami`, `omg visibility`, and `omg env` now run on this runtime. Agents get matching MCP tools. The old `@omg-dev/cli` 0.4.42 download is gone.
- A Cloud Computer does not store a user token. Cloud calls go through the guest proxy so Infra can attach the owner's credential. `omg login` on that Computer is a no-op.
- The iOS usage ring now lists each Claude profile with its own windows instead of one merged card.

## September 18, 2026 - Hosted videos start without a full download (v0.6.72)

- Transcript videos on the web and iOS now use short-lived signed artifact URLs. The browser and native player can request byte ranges and start playback before the complete recording downloads.
- Signed media URLs are limited to read-only artifact routes. The hosted proxy removes the grant before it forwards the request to the Computer.
- Poster frames and other hosted images can use the same direct URL path. Older hosts keep the existing authenticated blob fallback.

## September 17, 2026 - The omg agent runs on hosted Computers again (v0.6.71)

- On a hosted Computer the omg agent was reported as connected, became the default for a session that names no agent, and then failed every turn with `ProviderModelNotFoundError: Model not found: omg/...`. The Computer template no longer pre-bakes the omg provider into OpenCode's config, and the runtime trusted that it did. The runtime now writes the provider itself, pointed at the Computer's guest LLM proxy. **Hosted Computers need this release.** Local installs are unchanged.

## September 17, 2026 - New sessions pick an agent the Computer can run (v0.6.70)

- A new session that names no agent now gets one the Computer can actually run. The box reads its own `defaultAgent` setting first, then takes the first visible agent with a connected account (OpenCode counts without one), then the first configured agent. Before this, the box always answered Claude, so the first task from the iOS onboarding on a fresh hosted Computer came back "Not logged in". **Hosted Computers need this release** for the fix to apply. An explicit agent in the request is unchanged.
- Typing `#` in a composer now lists running threads only. Closed and archived sessions no longer appear in the picker.

## September 15, 2026 - Live Activities, scheduled runs in the archive, and iOS onboarding (v0.6.69)

- iOS Live Activities show the fleet on the Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island. The box publishes a bounded roster over `fleet.status` with each session's agent and state.
- A running row carries `startedAt`, so the phone counts the elapsed time on the device instead of needing a push every second. **This part needs a Computer on this release.** A Computer on an older build sends no start time, and the phone correctly falls back to the word "working" rather than showing a date in 1970.
- The archive hides scheduled runs by default and orders by archive time, with a control to show them again. This adds resume-cache migration 008.
- Hosted sessions get an automatic title from managed AI.
- `#` session references moved into `@omg-dev/protocol`, so the web and the native composers resolve them the same way.
- The iOS app has a revamped onboarding that asks what you want before it asks who you are, a Home Screen widget, and per-agent Live Activity rows. The app ships through the App Store and over the air, not in this bundle.

## September 12, 2026 - Stable message queues and mobile navigation (v0.6.68)

- Queued messages now leave the editable queue one at a time as the agent becomes available. The remaining messages stay visible across reconnects and restarts instead of moving into a hidden agent queue.
- Mobile Live now has a side navigation panel for pages and the computer switcher. Unread dots clear when the latest reply is visible. Agent icons are smaller, and chat headers show the selected model with a neutral reconnect label.
- Mobile project creation opens full-screen with explicit keyboard focus. Home receives fleet status over the shared live connection, and the chat navigation background is more transparent.
- Web composers support `#` references to sessions.

## September 12, 2026 - Shared fleet status subscription (v0.6.67)

- `@omg-dev/client`: `client.live.subscribeStatus(listener)` delivers fleet status rows over the existing shared WebSocket. Status-only consumers open the socket, reconnect with a fresh subscription, and release it when the last consumer leaves.
- Transcript and status subscriptions share one connection and have separate channel identities.

## September 12, 2026 - SDK owns transcript capabilities and drafts (v0.6.66)

- `@omg-dev/client`: `new OmgClient(transport, { capabilities: { workRows, deferToolArgs } })` declares the transcript capabilities on every live subscribe frame and on `getMessages`, whatever transport opened the socket. Before this, a client could opt in on one transport and miss the other, which is how the phone showed raw tool rows over omg.dev.
- `@omg-dev/client`: the live connection emits a `draft` event with the accumulated text and its `kind` (`text` or `thinking`), so a client no longer parses deltas itself or mistakes streamed reasoning for the reply.
- `@omg-dev/protocol`: `OmgMessage.steps` and `OmgMessage.tool` (work rows), `OmgDraft`, `OmgLiveCapabilities`.

## September 12, 2026 - One row per run of work, folded on the server (v0.6.65)

- A run of tool calls and thinking now arrives from the server as one "Worked for" row. The web app and the phone no longer build that row themselves, so both show the same rows for the same run.
- A displayed image, video, file, or dashboard sits under the run that made it. The display call no longer shows as a separate step.
- Every thought is part of its run, including the first one and the one still streaming.
- The old raw message stream is unchanged for clients that do not ask for rows, so an older phone build keeps working.

## September 12, 2026 - Queue messages while the agent works, Devin agent (v0.6.64)

- Queue a message while the agent is on a turn and it waits. It no longer reaches the agent right away. Queued messages show as a card under the composer, not in the chat. Click a message to edit it, or remove it. When the turn ends, every queued message is sent in order.
- New setting under Settings > More > View: "Send while the agent is working". Steer (default) interrupts the turn on Enter. Queue holds the message on Enter. The other action stays on Cmd/Ctrl+Enter and on holding the send button.
- Queued messages survive a page reload and a service restart.
- Dependencies: `js-yaml` 5 and `fast-uri` 4 overrides, `sharp` 0.35.4. The dependency audit is clean.
- New coding agent: Devin. It runs the Devin CLI locally through `devin acp`, so one session keeps its context across follow-up prompts. Pick it in the agent list; "adaptive" (Cognition's model router) is the default model, and Opus, GPT, Sonnet, Gemini, Codex, and Cognition's own SWE models are one pick away.
- On your own machine, install the Devin CLI (`curl -fsSL https://cli.devin.ai/install.sh | bash`), then run `devin auth login` once. A Devin, Windsurf, or API key (`WINDSURF_API_KEY`) login all work.

## September 10, 2026 - Hosted omg agent balance and models (v0.6.63)

- Hosted Computers can show the omg agent's monthly AI credit ring without asking the sandbox for an `omg login`.
- The omg agent model list adds Claude Fable 5.1, Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Terra, and GPT-5.6 Luna.

## September 10, 2026 - Rounder sent messages (v0.6.62)

- Sent messages have a rounder bubble.
- The copy button next to a sent message is gone. Long-press the message (right-click on desktop) and choose Copy message.

## September 10, 2026 - AI credit for the omg agent (v0.6.61)

- The usage rings in the composer now cover the omg agent. One monthly ring shows how much of your plan's AI credit is used and when it resets.
- Agent icons in the session list are no longer rounded.

## September 10, 2026 - The omg agent has its own icon (v0.6.60)

- The omg agent shows the omg mark in the agent picker and in session lists. It showed a broken image before.
- Mobile: the machine leads the home bar, as on the web.

## September 10, 2026 - The omg agent (v0.6.59)

- New coding agent: omg agent. It runs OpenCode on models that omg pays for with the AI credit in your Computer plan. Pick it in the agent list, then pick one of 7 models. DeepSeek V4 Flash is the default.
- On your own machine, the omg agent signs in with your omg account. If you are not signed in, the launch says: Sign in with `omg login` to use the omg agent.

## September 10, 2026 - A run of work is one row (v0.6.58)

- In the transcript, an agent's thoughts and tool calls between two messages are one row. It reads "Working for 4s" while the agent works and "Worked for 21s" when the next message arrives. Open the row to see every step.
- iOS: the same run rows, with a sheet of every step.
- iOS: Auto findings are grouped per agent with a count. Open the row to see them.
- iOS: tap a file in the transcript to open its page. Text files and CSV preview on the page. Download is an icon in the navigation bar and opens the share sheet.
- iOS: the agent's question card sits above the composer.
- iOS: the keyboard closes after you send a message.
- iOS: swipe to archive keeps working when the swipe drifts up or down.
- iOS: the thinking row has no chevron.

## September 8, 2026 - Adding a connector opens sign-in (v0.6.57)

- Adding an OAuth connector opens sign-in immediately.
- Custom MCP URLs default to OAuth. You can also choose an auth header or no authentication.
- If sign-in fails or a popup is blocked, the saved connector stays available. Use Connect to retry.

## September 8, 2026 - Media reads like chat, files open a page (v0.6.56)

- Images and videos in the transcript have no card. The media stands alone with a small caption under it.
- Tap a file card to open its page. The page shows the name, type, and size, and a Download button.
- Text files and code preview on the page. CSV and TSV show as a table. Files over 1 MB ask before they load, and show the first 1 MB.
- Archives, PDFs, audio, and unknown types show no preview. Download them to open them.
- The file card is one row. On a mouse, the download icon appears on hover. On a touch screen, the page has the Download button.
- The thinking row has no chevron.
- Text labels on the Live header, the thinking timer, and busy buttons morph in place.
- Web terminal: select and copy text while tmux mouse mode is on.
- Computer: copy and paste between the device and the desktop. Trackpad mode stays on after a tap. A mouse event within one second of a touch is ignored.
- Auto findings: a refine marks the finding read, not dismissed. A rewrite grounded in a finding dismisses it when it lands. Feedback refine answers at once.
- Faster live updates: the socket sends only the status rows that changed, unchanged polls do not re-render, and every asset is compressed.
- iPad: the selected rail row is a flat tint, not a card.

## September 7, 2026 - File downloads work on managed machines (v0.6.55)

- Downloading a file from a managed machine stays on the machine. A redirect from the machine no longer sends the browser to the wrong path.
- Downloads through a managed machine now report their size, so the browser shows real progress.
- The file card is one click target. Click the file name to download it.
- On omg.dev hosted sessions the card shows a percentage while a file downloads, and it says when a download fails. Click again to retry.
- iPad: the session rail shares the phone header, and the composer is the empty pane.
- Return sends in the session composer. New sessions follow the project filter.

## September 7, 2026 - Tool access works inside omg.dev (v0.6.54)

- Roles and connectors load from your machine when Settings is opened inside omg.dev. The "Unexpected token '<'" error is gone.
- Hosts can route the Tool access page like Coding agents and Storage, so it opens as its own page with a back link.

## September 6, 2026 - Edit names beside each machine (v0.6.53)

- Use the pencil beside a machine to edit its name without switching machines.
- Save names for cloud, connected, and local machines. Connected names stay in place after reconnecting.
- The separate Rename cloud machine menu item is removed.

## September 6, 2026 - Keep cloud recovery status clear (v0.6.52)

- The greeting keeps “Connecting…” while a ready cloud computer finishes its client connection. It no longer briefly shows “Connection unavailable” during this handoff.

## September 6, 2026 - Add machines and name your cloud machine (v0.6.51)

- Add a machine from the machine menu. Choose your own computer or omg.dev cloud.
- Copy install and connection commands, then see when pairing succeeds or expires.
- Rename your cloud machine and see its saved name across your devices.
- Opening the machine menu does not create cloud compute. Cloud creation starts after you choose it.

## September 6, 2026 - Cloud startup progress in the greeting (v0.6.50)

- **The greeting shows confirmed cloud startup progress.** It shows “Waking your
  computer…” or “Starting your computer…” while the cloud backend reports an
  active startup. A confirmed failure has separate text. Older servers retain
  the existing connection display.

## September 6, 2026 - Tibo mode shows one control, and archive undoes itself (v0.6.49)

- **The Tibo pill hides when it cannot be used.** An agent or model that
  cannot run Tibo mode now shows no pill, instead of a permanently disabled
  one that did not say which model to pick.
- **Archiving a session is optimistic everywhere, and it can undo itself.**
  The keyboard path (shift+E) now removes the row immediately, like swipe and
  the session menu. A failed close request restores the row and reports the
  error, instead of hiding a session that is still live until you reload.

## September 6, 2026 - Tibo mode is one control, not three (v0.6.48)

- **Tibo mode hides the thinking and Fast pills while it is on.** Tibo mode
  already pins Fast service and High thinking, so the composer showed three
  controls for one decision. The Tibo pill is now the only one visible while
  it is active, and turning it off restores the other two.

## September 5, 2026 - Free OpenCode default follows what the box can use (v0.6.47)

- **The free OpenCode default is the best free model the box actually
  discovers.** OpenCode advertises a different free set to each box, and the
  retired `deepseek-v4-flash-free` was still first in that set on a fresh
  omg.dev Computer. LFG now launches the first known-working free model the
  box offers, and never offers a retired model.

## September 5, 2026 - Free OpenCode default really launches (v0.6.46)

- **An anonymous box now launches the configured free OpenCode model.** The
  picker used to take the first free model that OpenCode's catalog listed,
  which was still the retired `deepseek-v4-flash-free`. The configured
  default (`opencode/nemotron-3.5-lightning-free`) now wins whenever the
  catalog offers it.

## September 5, 2026 - Update coding agents and refresh models from Settings (v0.6.45)

- **Settings can update a coding agent CLI and refresh its models.** Expand
  an installed agent and tap Update to reinstall the latest CLI, then re-probe
  its model list. Refresh models at the top of the page re-probes without
  waiting for the daily catalog cron. This is how an existing Computer picks
  up a new Codex model such as GPT-6 Astra.

## September 5, 2026 - Mobile chat layout and auto-agent pages (v0.6.44)

- **OpenCode default model is `opencode/nemotron-3.5-lightning-free`.** The
  previous default, `opencode/deepseek-v4-flash-free`, now fails on
  OpenCode's side with `Unexpected server error` and is gone from the
  OpenCode catalog. A new box, and every omg.dev free Computer, picks the
  working model.

- **Chat messages keep their measured heights during keyboard changes.**
  Opening or closing the mobile keyboard while messages arrive no longer
  leaves rows at estimated heights that can make messages overlap.
- **Auto-agent reports and editing use full pages.** The report and editor
  have more room to scroll on mobile and desktop.

## September 5, 2026 - omg Cloud sign-in and machine switching (v0.6.43)

- **Sign in to omg Cloud from Settings.** The box runs the sign-in through
  `auth.omg.dev` and keeps the credential in `~/.omg/credentials.json`, the
  same file `omg login` writes. The browser never holds the token.
- **Switch the UI onto any machine on your account.** A machine switcher at
  the bottom of the session rail (an icon at the top left on mobile) lists
  your cloud Computer and every paired box. Pick one and the UI reloads
  pointed at it. The box mints the grant and proxies HTTP and WebSocket
  traffic, and wakes a paused cloud Computer on demand. Nothing changes for
  an install that is not signed in.
- **Hosts can draw the same switcher.** `OmgAppSurface` takes a `machines`
  prop with the host's list, the active id and an `onSelect` callback.
- **New package `@omg-dev/cloud`.** The account client shared by the local
  UI, the hosted app and the native app: sign-in, machine list, session
  grants, one transport per machine, readiness.
- **`@omg-dev/client`:** `createSameOriginTransport({ basePath })` prefixes
  every path, which is how the UI switches machines with one transport swap.

## September 5, 2026 - GPT-6 Astra in Codex (v0.6.42)

- **GPT-6 Astra is available for Codex sessions.** Eligible accounts can select
  `gpt-6-astra` in the model picker and use Codex Fast mode with it.
- **The bundled Codex runtime is current.** The Codex SDK and CLI runtime move
  to 0.153.4.

## September 4, 2026 - Fix: the release bundle could not start (v0.6.41)

- **`omg serve` starts again from a release install.** Every bundle since
  v0.6.39 was missing the `@omg-dev/connectors` package that the server
  imports, so a fresh install or update failed on start with
  `Cannot find package '@omg-dev/connectors'`. The release now ships the
  package, and a test keeps it that way.

## September 4, 2026 - Auto agent reports and a clearer schedule editor (v0.6.40)

- **One row per auto agent in the Auto section.** Findings from the same
  agent no longer stack as separate rows. The row shows the agent, a count
  pill, the worst open finding, and a severity dot in the unread-dot slot.
- **Agent report sheet.** Tap a row to open the agent's report. It lists the
  open findings worst first, with the last sighting and how many runs repeated
  each one. Tap a finding to read it and act on it in place. Dismiss all or
  edit the schedule from the footer.
- **Full-height sheets on mobile.** The finding sheet, the report sheet and the
  schedule editor are full pages on a phone. The composer no longer hides
  behind the keyboard.
- **Schedules list rows are two lines.** The name gets the full width. The
  "N open" pill opens the agent's report.
- **Schedule editor redesign.** The prompt comes first. Schedule, repo, agent
  and enabled sit in one grouped card. The schedule picker has labelled rows.
  Save and Run now stay pinned at the bottom.
- **Meta Muse Code is available as a coding agent.**
- **Agents can show any file with `omg_display_file`.**
- **Mobile app:** findings are rows like the web live list, and the app gains a
  user filter, a Pages menu and a Schedules screen.

## September 4, 2026 - Banked Codex resets in Usage (v0.6.39)

- **Usage shows every banked Codex reset.** The Codex row now gives the
  authoritative available count, each returned expiry date and grant date, and
  says when Codex returned a count without all detail rows.
- **A selected reset can be used from Usage.** Each available credit has a
  `Use reset` button, followed by an explicit confirmation because redemption
  immediately resets the current Codex limit and cannot be undone.
- **The remaining stock is hard to miss.** A prominent counter says exactly
  how many resets are still available before any action is taken.
- **Codex usage is current when the local app server is available.** Older
  Codex installs still fall back to the last session snapshot for the normal
  usage windows.
## September 4, 2026 - Native integrations and per-role tool access (v0.6.39)

- **Connect integrations natively.** The Integrations panel lists your
  connectors with their logos. It uses the integrations.sh catalog. The old
  embedded iframe is gone.
- **OAuth connect for a connector.** You authorize a connector in a popup. omg
  owns the callback and stores the tokens encrypted on the box. The flow
  completes over remote access.
- **Add a custom MCP or OpenAPI source.** The custom source form is collapsed
  behind a button so the panel stays clean.
- **Per-member and per-role tool access.** Each member gets connectors scoped to
  the member. A role controls which tools a session can use.
- **Approve connector calls from chat.** A restricted role must get approval in
  the chat before a connector tool runs.
- **Sandbox for restricted roles.** A restricted-role session runs with a
  bubblewrap filesystem sandbox and a per-role network egress allowlist.

## September 3, 2026 - Board in the desktop workspace (v0.6.38)

- **The Board sits in the desktop workspace.** On a wide screen the session
  rail stays on the left with its project selector. The four columns fill the
  stage. The old header pill is gone from this page.
- **A card opens its session beside the Board.** Click a card and the session
  opens as a column next to the columns. Close it to return to the Board alone.
  Narrow screens still open the session page.
- **Sidebar faces follow the agent icon switch.** Turn off "Agent icons in the
  sidebar" and the assignee face on each session row is hidden too.
- **New setting: "Worktree diff badge in chat".** Turn it off to hide the
  floating changes bar above the composer.
- **Also in this release.** The read-only Board page (every task as a kanban,
  at `/board`), box defaults for agent and model with View switches in
  Settings, an agent picker switch that can force the default agent, the agent
  and model switches on the mobile inline composer, and Sign in with Apple and
  Google in the mobile app.

## September 3, 2026 - Fold a session group shut (v0.6.37)

- **Session rail groups fold.** Every group header carries a chevron: Pinned,
  each folder, and Auto. Click it to hide the rows in that group. The label and
  the count stay. Click it again to show the rows.
- **A fold is remembered.** The folded groups are kept in this browser, so a
  group that you shut is still shut after a reload. The desktop rail and the
  mobile list share one answer. A folder that you rename keeps its fold.
- **A folded group still shows unread.** If a session inside a shut group is
  unread, the group header shows the unread dot. A fold cannot hide news.
- **The keyboard cursor obeys the fold.** `j`, `k` and the arrow keys move only
  through rows that you can see. The icon-collapsed rail has no headers, so it
  cannot fold, and it keeps every row.

## September 2, 2026 - Desktop lands on the composer, Schedules move inline (v0.6.36)

- **The desktop stage opens on a "Hello {name}!" composer.** With nothing
  pinned, New session (button, rail, or `C`) fills the chat area. There is no
  drawer and no "No session open" card. The stage no longer previews a session
  on load, so it can no longer pick a bot by mistake.
- **Agent and model are one pill.** The desktop composer shows the agent icon
  and the model name in one control. Its popover lists the agents and the
  models for the chosen agent, and always opens downward. The thinking pill
  shows the signal bars and the level only.
- **Schedules show inside the desktop workspace.** The session rail stays on
  the left and the list fills the stage. Each row is the name, when it runs,
  and the switch. Click a row to edit it. Enabled rows come first.
- **Hosted: Settings moves into the rail's Pages menu.** The desktop rail
  footer slot now carries `data-lfg-host-settings="menu"`, so a host that
  reads it can drop its own Settings control there.
- **The omg.dev instructions chip now shows your standing rules.** Custom
  instructions already went to the agent. The chip only showed the runtime
  contract, so they looked missing. Open the chip on an existing session and
  they are there. No new session is needed.

## September 2, 2026 - Claude Fable 5.1 for the SDK Claude agent too (v0.6.35)

- **The picker has two agents named "claude".** One is the Claude CLI harness.
  The other is the Agent SDK harness, which the interface also labels
  "claude". v0.6.34 added Claude Fable 5.1 to the CLI harness only, so most
  users did not see the new model.
- **Claude Fable 5.1 is now on both.** The Agent SDK accepts the same model
  strings as the CLI, aliases or full ids.

## September 2, 2026 - Claude Fable 5.1 is in the model picker (v0.6.34)

- **You can select Claude Fable 5.1 for a Claude session.** The picker shows it
  as `claude-fable-5-1`, next to the existing `fable` entry.
- **`fable` and `claude-fable-5-1` are different models.** The Claude CLI
  resolves the short alias `fable` to the current Fable release, which is
  Fable 5. There is no short alias for Fable 5.1 yet. The full model id is the
  only way to reach it.
- **A Fable 5.1 session now reports the correct model.** Before this change the
  session view collapsed every Fable id to `fable`. A Fable 5.1 session showed
  Fable 5 as the live model, and a resume moved that session to Fable 5.
- **Fable 5.1 costs more than Opus 5.** The rate is 10 USD for each million
  input tokens and 50 USD for each million output tokens. Thinking is always
  on. Select it for hard work. Do not use it as a default.

## September 1, 2026 - Agents can paste into the desktop browser (v0.6.33)

- **The Computer Use MCP has a new tool: computer_paste.** It puts text on
  the desktop clipboard and sends a real Ctrl+V to the agent's tab. Paste
  handlers fire. Fields that react to paste now work. Verification-code boxes
  that split digits are the common case. computer_type cannot fill them,
  because it never sends a paste event.
- **The text stays on the desktop clipboard.** A person watching the Computer
  tab can paste it again with Ctrl+V.
- **The clipboard write uses xclip, not the page.** No clipboard permission is
  granted to any page. Paste also works on plain-http pages. If xclip is not
  installed, the tool error says how to install it.

## September 1, 2026 - The transcript holds still while you type (v0.6.32)

- **Typing no longer moves the transcript.** The message box measures itself
  after every keystroke. That measurement collapsed the box to zero height for
  one layout pass, which made the transcript above it taller by the full height
  of the box. The browser then pulled the scroll position to the shorter
  maximum, and the transcript snapped back to the newest message. This is most
  visible on a phone, where the message box is a large part of the screen.
- **The measurement now stays inside the message box.** Nothing above the box
  moves while it measures. The box still grows and shrinks with your text.

## September 1, 2026 - The faces move to the right of the header (v0.6.31)

- **The faces are now where the assignee avatar used to be.** They sat under
  the session title. They now sit at the right end of the header, next to the
  model name, which is where people look to see who is on a session.
- **Tapping them still opens the list.** The list is unchanged. It names each
  person and says who owns the session.

## September 1, 2026 - Tap the faces to see who is in the session (v0.6.30)

- **The faces in the header now open a list.** Tap or click them. The list
  names each person and says who owns the session and who is a member. It also
  says who is typing.
- **The blue ring is gone.** The owner had a coloured ring on a 16 pixel face.
  The ring was a quarter of the circle, so it looked like a blue background
  instead of a highlight. The list says "Owner" in words instead.

## September 1, 2026 - The bot is named once in a header, not three times (v0.6.29)

- **A bot no longer appears three times in one session header.** The header
  already carries the bot as the title and as the "driven by" badge. The
  participant row listed it a third time, as a pill between the people. The row
  now shows people only.
- **The faces sit together again.** The bot pill was placed between the two
  people, so the group of faces was split apart. The people are now next to
  each other, and the person the session belongs to keeps the coloured ring.
- **A session with one person and a bot shows no faces.** One person is not a
  group, and the bot is named elsewhere in the same header.

## September 1, 2026 - Custom instructions for every session (v0.6.28)

- **Settings now holds your standing instructions.** Settings has a new "Custom
  instructions" row. It opens a page where you write your rules one time. Every
  new session then carries them, on every agent. Examples are "Ask before you
  push" and "Always run the tests before you say you are done".
- **Your rules do not clutter the session list.** The text travels with the
  omg.dev runtime contract, in front of your task. Session cards and titles
  still show the task that you asked for.
- **Repository files still win.** An AGENTS.md or a CLAUDE.md in the code that
  an agent edits overrules your standing rules, because those files are scoped
  to that code.

## September 1, 2026 - One set of faces on the session header (v0.6.27)

- **The assigned person is no longer drawn two times.** The session header
  showed them in the participant row under the title, and again as a separate
  avatar at the other end of the same bar. There is one group of faces now.
- **The faces overlap, and the assigned person has a coloured ring.** The ring
  carries what the second avatar used to say, so the header gives the same
  information in less space.

## September 1, 2026 - One keystroke, one action (v0.6.26)

- **Shift+E no longer opens two archive dialogs.** When two workspace surfaces
  were alive in the same window, each one handled the same key press. One
  Shift+E asked to archive the session two times, and one "c" started two new
  sessions. The surfaces now agree on one owner for each key press. The owner is
  the surface that you work in.
- **The keyboard picks the surface you touched.** The key press goes to the
  surface that holds the key target, or the focus, or your last touch. Every
  other surface ignores it. The single window app keeps its behavior.

## September 1, 2026 - Clear the findings feed in one action (v0.6.25)

- **Auto agent findings can now be cleared all at once.** The feed had no way
  to empty a backlog. Each finding had to be dismissed one at a time from its
  own sheet. The "Auto" group header now has a "Clear all" button. It asks for
  a second click before it runs, and it names the number it is about to clear.
- **Clearing dismisses. It does not delete.** Your agents still remember what
  you cleared, so they do not raise the same thing again on the next run, and a
  problem that comes back still escalates. High severity findings are never
  silenced this way, so a real outage still reaches you.
- **Clearing obeys the project filter.** When the list is scoped to one
  project, the button clears only the findings it shows you.

## August 31, 2026 - The version shown is the version running (v0.6.24)

- **A box that has downloaded an update no longer claims to be up to date.**
  The update status compared the files on disk against the newest release and
  never looked at the code actually running. So the moment an update was
  written, the box reported itself current while still serving the older
  version, and the person reading it had no way to tell. It now reports the
  version this process is running, and says "installed, starts after a restart"
  for the window in between.
- **The restart you need is offered.** When an update is on disk but not yet
  running, the update prompt appears with a restart rather than going quiet.
  Skipping a download no longer also silences the restart it turned out to
  need, because those are two different things to be told about.
- **The list of what is new stays visible until you restart.** It used to empty
  itself the moment an update landed on disk, hiding the release notes from the
  only person who still needed them.

## August 31, 2026 - Fast mode for Codex and Claude (v0.6.23)

- **Fast mode is now its own switch, for Claude as well as Codex.** Speed used
  to be tied to the Tibo service tier and was available to Codex alone. It is
  now an independent setting in the composer that Claude sessions can use too,
  and it no longer changes your reasoning effort as a side effect: the two are
  set separately.
- **Turn it on from the composer or from the chat.** Use the composer control,
  or type `/fast`, `/fast on` or `/fast off`. Only those exact commands are
  read as commands, so a message that merely begins with the word is still sent
  as a message.
- **Your choice is remembered per provider.** Codex and Claude keep their own
  preference, so turning it on for one does not change the other.
- **Codex offers it only where the model supports it.** The control appears for
  Codex sessions on the GPT-5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 models, and stays hidden elsewhere
  rather than offering a setting that would not apply.
- **Resumed sessions come back with the same setting.** Fast mode, thinking
  level and service tier are now stored with the session, so reopening one
  restores the mode it was running in.

## August 31, 2026 - See who else is in a session (v0.6.22)

- **A shared session now shows who is in it.** An ordinary coding session used
  to look identical whether you were working alone or with three other people.
  It now shows their faces in the header, draws each person's avatar and name
  beside the messages they wrote, and shows a live indicator while somebody
  else is typing. Your own messages are unchanged, and a session you are
  working on alone is unchanged too: with only one person there, no faces and
  no indicator appear at all.
- **A person typing is shown as a person, not as the agent working.** The
  typing indicator for a teammate is separate from the dots that mean the agent
  is producing an answer, so a half-written question from someone else can
  never be mistaken for the agent thinking.
- **Someone typing stays visible across a bot restart.** Presence now follows
  the conversation rather than the individual run behind it. Restarting a bot
  no longer clears everyone from the indicator, and two people looking at the
  same conversation through different runs can now see each other.
- **Faces appear on a self-hosted box, not only a hosted one.** Message avatars
  and the header roster now work the same way in both places. A box with a
  configured roster of users shows them; a box with no roster configured shows
  nothing, exactly as before.
- **Nobody gets the wrong face.** A message is only labelled when the box can
  say who sent it. If two people send the exact same words in one session, that
  turn is left unlabelled rather than guessed at, and a message the box cannot
  attribute renders as it always has.

## August 31, 2026 - Command details open again in the hosted app (v0.6.21)

- **Command details load instead of showing a browser error.** Opening a tool
  pill in the hosted app returned "The string did not match the expected
  pattern." for every command. The transcript no longer carries tool arguments,
  so the panel fetches them per command, and that one fetch used the browser's
  global fetch instead of the transport the host installs. It therefore asked
  the host page's own origin rather than the selected computer, received the
  web app's HTML in place of the answer, and printed Safari's parser message at
  the reader. The panel now uses the host transport like every other request.
  An answer that is not the expected data also reports as a response problem
  now, instead of quoting the browser.

## August 31, 2026 - Pictures hold their place in the transcript while they load (v0.6.20)

- **A picture no longer drops the message below it on top of the one above.**
  An image in the transcript occupied no height at all until it finished
  loading. The transcript only draws the rows you can see, and it places each
  one directly under the measured height of the row before it, so every row
  below a picture was placed against a card that was momentarily a single line
  tall. The moment the picture arrived, that card grew by its full height with
  the next row still inside it, and what that painted was your own message
  drawn over the tail of the reply above it. A picture now reserves the exact
  space it will occupy from the first frame, so nothing below it moves when it
  loads. Measured on a real session at phone width with the image cache off:
  the same row was 42 pixels tall before the picture arrived, and is 426 now.

## August 31, 2026 - An honest token usage inspector and a self-healing session page (v0.6.19)

- **Token usage no longer counts free space as used.** The inspector asked
  Claude for a context breakdown and charted the answer as-is. That answer is a
  layout of the whole context window, not a list of what fills it, so it also
  carries a "Free space" remainder, a reserved autocompact buffer, and tool
  schemas that are advertised but never loaded. All of it was drawn as
  consumption. A session that reported 317k of 1.0M listed categories adding up
  to 1.27M, with "Free space" as the largest single entry, and the bar divides
  by that total, so every proportion was wrong as well. The real Messages row,
  which was almost all of the context, showed as a quarter of the bar. The
  breakdown now counts only what occupies the window. Every one of the 585
  recorded snapshots on the development machine was affected.
- **The mobile transcript appears settled, not mid-move.** A session opened on
  the native app revealed its messages one frame after they arrived, but the
  list keeps correcting its position for up to three seconds, because rows
  mount in batches and an image has no height until it loads. On a real device
  that showed as a transcript parked mid-conversation, with one bubble drawn
  over the tail of the reply above it and the "New activity" pill still up. The
  app now waits for the list to go quiet before it reveals it. A session opened
  while a reply is streaming never goes quiet, so it reveals after 1.2 seconds
  instead of waiting. The opening spinner already covered this moment, so the
  cost is a slightly longer spinner.
- **The session page recovers from a failed code-split chunk.** Safari could
  show "Importing a module script failed." on a session, from the router error
  boundary, and the page stayed broken. Three parts of the session page loaded
  their code without the retry that the rest of the app uses: the chat engine,
  the assistant message renderer and the diff viewer. A chunk that fails to
  arrive now reloads once and recovers. The background warm-up of the chat
  engine no longer reports its own failure as an error, because the page
  re-requests that code when it renders.

## August 30, 2026 - A flat desktop workspace, agent account names, and remote access in Settings (v0.6.18)

- **The desktop workspace no longer draws cards around itself.** The session
  rail and the session stage each rendered as a rounded card with a border, a
  fill and a drop shadow, floating on the app background with a gap between
  them. On a full width window that is chrome around chrome. Both are flat now.
  A single divider line separates the rail from the stage, and the stage runs
  to the window edge. The session header on the stage is 44px instead of 60px,
  because it carries one line of title there. Phones and iPad portrait are not
  affected. They use a different layout that keeps its cards, and the card is
  what makes a stacked list of sessions readable.
- **Coding agents say which account they are signed in as.** Detection could
  only answer whether an account was connected. A machine with several agents
  under different logins looked the same as one machine with a single login,
  and multi-account Claude showed "Claude 1" and "Claude 2", which name
  nothing. Each agent now reads the credential file its own CLI already
  writes and shows the account. No credential material is copied. A profile
  appears only when you connected an account, so a platform API key never
  reports a login you did not make.
- **Settings shows how to reach this server from another device.** A new
  Remote access section gives the local URL, and the Tailscale state of the
  machine with the exact command to serve it over your tailnet.
- **The desktop app keeps scheduled work running after you quit.** The app
  used to attach to any healthy server on loopback and stop its own child on
  exit, which ended schedules with the window. It now owns an isolated
  embedded runtime that stays active after the window closes. A later launch
  reconnects to it. A package update replaces it with the new build.

## August 28, 2026 - A desktop app preview, unread marks for chats, and the DeepSeek Harness (v0.6.17)

- **A chat that landed a reply you have not read now carries a dot.** The
  roster could draw a session working, and it could draw nothing. "Nothing"
  meant finished a second ago, finished and already read, and finished last
  March, all at once, so the one state a person waits for had no mark. The dot
  is per person, so two identities on one box do not clear each other. It is
  held back while the session is working, because it means "ready for you" and
  a session in the middle of a turn is not. It clears when the transcript is
  actually on screen, not when a stored preference says a column is open. The
  row menu has "Mark as read", and the Chat tab carries the same dot that Bots
  already had.
- **An unread row is no longer tinted.** The dot, the tooltip and the screen
  reader label say it. The row tint said it a third time, and a list with a few
  unread sessions in it read as alarmed. Bot rows never had the tint, so the
  two kinds of row now match.
- **There is a desktop app preview for macOS and Linux.** It is a Bun-native
  Electrobun shell that contains the omg.dev web UI and server, so the packaged
  app needs no separate Bun or CLI install. It always starts and owns an
  isolated runtime, even when another omg.dev server is already running. The
  window is shown after its runtime and app are ready. Builds come from the
  `desktop-package` workflow as downloadable artifacts. They are not part of
  this release bundle.
- **DeepSeek Harness is available as a coding agent.** It is in the agent
  catalog, the setup script, and the coding agent adapters, like the other
  harnesses.
- **OpenCode reports the models and variants of your connected providers.**
- **A `codex exec` session is titled by its real prompt.** A non-interactive
  run records its prompt in a form the title scan dropped, so every exec
  rollout fell back to the directory name. A batch of runs in one directory
  produced identical rows in the Live roster and in resume history. The scan
  now falls back to the first user turn in the transcript, and it skips the
  wrapper blocks that Codex injects ahead of the real prompt.
- **A session row hides the assignee badge when it repeats what the row
  already says.**
- **The native iOS client gained the web app's list, session view and
  sign-in.** The subagent tree lines are aimed at the mark they descend from,
  the list can be scoped by folder, and the usage rings open. The client ships
  through TestFlight and EAS Update, not through this release bundle.

## August 27, 2026 - The native iOS client, native push, and a matched dark theme (v0.6.16)

- **The native omg.dev client for iOS now lives in this repository.** The
  `mobile/` directory held a todo prototype while the real client was developed
  on a branch. The real client is now on `main`: sign-in, sessions, transcript
  and composer, dictation, the Bots roster and bot chat, shared Computers, and
  the plan screen. It ships through TestFlight and EAS Update, not through this
  release bundle.
- **The dark theme is softer, and an installed app's status bar now matches
  it.** The background moved from pure black to #141414, and body text moved
  from pure white to a warm off-white. The chrome of an installed app kept its
  own copies of the old colour, so an iPhone home-screen app painted a black
  status bar above a lighter page. The theme colour, the splash, the safe-area
  strips, the boot-failure page, and the web manifest now all use the same
  value.
- **The server can send push notifications to the native app.** Delivery goes
  through Expo and APNs, and it is fanned out from the same path as every other
  notification, so existing callers inherit it with the same user scoping. The
  payload is deliberately redacted: it carries a per-kind title and a project
  name, and never the question text. Delivery needs a native build and an APNs
  key.
- **The usage summary now arrives in one request.** `/api/usage/summary` groups
  sources by kind, averages clamped windows by label, keeps the soonest reset,
  and excludes accounts that did not report. A remote client no longer pays one
  round trip per account. The per-account routes remain available.
- **Batch dictation now picks a provider that can perform it.** The fallback
  matched any provider that defined a transcribe function, which included the
  hosted relay. That relay is realtime-only and always answers 503, so a
  workspace with a working ElevenLabs or OpenAI key still failed. Batch-capable
  providers are now marked, and only they are selected.
- **A session row falls back to the local placeholder when an avatar cannot
  load.** The fallback chain ended at Gravatar, which always returns a URL. On a
  box that cannot reach gravatar.com, every row rendered a broken image. The
  configured identity now stays visible without a network.

## August 27, 2026 - Session sharing, pinned chats sync, and env-token Claude accounts (v0.6.15)

- **A Claude login held in `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` now counts as a connected
  account.** A box authenticated only through that variable showed the default
  Claude account as disconnected, and the Coding Agents page asked for a login
  that was not needed. Sessions launched from such a box worked the whole time,
  so the page disagreed with the runtime. The account row now reads "From
  CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN", and the re-login button is hidden there, because the
  variable outranks anything a browser sign-in stores. An isolated account no
  longer inherits the variable, so accounts cannot all run on one login.
- **Hosted sessions show who they are shared with.** The session list carries an
  assignee avatar, and a user filter menu narrows the list to one person.
- **Pinned chats now follow your account instead of one browser.** Pins are held
  by the server, so a session pinned on one device appears pinned on the others.
- **The thread rail shows project favicons.** Each project in the rail carries
  its own icon, and the activity marks beside it are simpler to read.
- **Voice failures now explain what to fix.** Batch dictation no longer goes
  silent when a provider rejects a key, runs out of API credit, rate limits a
  request, or cannot be reached. The server returns a stable safe error code,
  and the composer shows an actionable message without exposing the provider's
  response body. The mic also reports its starting and transcribing states to
  assistive technology.
- **Long-press uses the native iPhone selection controls again.** A user can
  select and adjust any part of a message, while the separate copy button
  remains available for copying the whole message in one tap.
- **Swipe between chats is now optional per device.** The new switch under
  Settings > More > This device disables only the horizontal chat-switching
  gesture. Vertical scrolling, native text selection, and other gestures keep
  working normally.
- **Opening the keyboard no longer scrolls the newest message away.** A
  transcript pinned to the latest turn stays pinned when the soft keyboard
  opens or closes.
- **Headings in an answer are no longer smaller than the text they introduce.**
  A rule written for the user bubble was applying to every assistant reply, so
  H1, H2 and H3 all rendered at 14px against 17px body text. The rule is now
  scoped to the user bubble.
- **Computer Use refuses a debugging port that another process already holds.**
  Before, a box that already had a browser on port 9222 reported a successful
  start while Chrome had in fact exited. The desktop stayed empty and every
  Computer Use call went to the other browser. The start now fails and says so.
- The onboarding survey is cut to two questions, and its analytics are posted to
  the embedding host rather than sent from the sandboxed frame, where every
  event was being dropped.
- **Deployment note:** pi resolves its proxy base from `OMG_AI_URL` when
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is unset. There is no behavior change while infra still
  injects `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, which keeps priority. This release must be
  rebaked into the agent template before the infra side stops injecting the
  vendor-named variable.

## August 25, 2026 - OpenCode Go models appear without a Claude account (v0.6.14)

- **An OpenCode Go key alone now unlocks OpenCode's paid models.** If OpenCode
  was the only agent signed in on a box, the picker showed the free Zen tier
  and nothing else — even with a Go key connected and every `opencode-go/*`
  model already discovered. The box was being treated as anonymous because the
  "is someone signed in here" check counted only Claude and Codex. Anyone
  paying for OpenCode Go and using nothing else was being billed for models the
  picker hid from them.
- The check that stops a *Claude* account from unlocking OpenCode's paid
  providers is unchanged. A box whose OpenCode was never signed into still gets
  the free tier, because offering models that fail at launch is worse than
  offering fewer.

## August 25, 2026 - Pin a bot to a specific Claude account (v0.6.13)

- **The bot editor now lets you choose which Claude account a bot runs on.**
  Open Edit bot, then Advanced. The agent row lists Claude - Auto and every
  connected account, the same picker sessions and routines already had. Before,
  a bot always fell back to the automatic account pick.
- Claude - Auto keeps the old behavior. It picks the connected account with the
  most headroom at launch.
- Changing the account is a launch setting, so the bot reads "Update available"
  after you save. The new account applies when you press Apply changes.
- A pinned account that is removed or signed out falls back to Claude - Auto.
  The bot still starts.
- A bot created by another bot inherits that bot's account, the same way it
  already inherits the repo and the owner.

## August 25, 2026 - Tagging a bot with @ now reaches the bot (v0.6.12)

- **An `@` tag in a session chat delivers the message to that bot.** Before,
  the tag was only text and routed nowhere. The tag carries the bot identity,
  so renaming a bot or having two bots with the same name cannot send the
  message to the wrong one.
- The tagged bot joins the conversation from the point it was tagged. It does
  not read the earlier history of that session.
- A tag for a bot that is unknown, disabled, or restarting is reported instead
  of being dropped without a word.
- **Note:** the tagged bot answers in its own chat. Its reply does not appear
  in the session that tagged it.

## August 25, 2026 - Tag a bot with @ in the composer (v0.6.11)

- **Typing `@` in the message box opens a bot picker.** Search your bots by
  name, then press Enter or Tab to insert the tag. The picker is available in
  every composer, including chat and the new-session box.
- The picker skips bots that are disabled, because a disabled bot cannot
  accept a message. It does not open on an email address such as
  `name@example.com`.
- The tag is text in the message. It does not notify or route to the bot yet.

## August 25, 2026 - Mobile chat stays focused and Grok thoughts stay private (v0.6.10)

- **Grok reasoning no longer appears as an assistant answer while it streams.**
  The live protocol now keeps thinking and answer text as separate typed data.
  The fix does not inspect Grok text or depend on provider-specific markers.
- **Mobile chat keeps the hardware keyboard ready after send.** The composer
  retains focus without reopening the software keyboard.
- **Live transcript motion is faster and the keyboard gap is gone.** New chat
  activity reaches the bottom sooner, and the composer no longer leaves an
  empty inset after the mobile keyboard closes.

## August 25, 2026 - Switch bar says Schedules (v0.6.9)

- **The Chat / Bots / Schedules toggle now says Schedules.** The page heading
  already used that word. The third segment was still labeled Scheduled.

## August 25, 2026 - Chat streams more smoothly (v0.6.8)

- **Assistant markdown now uses Streamdown 2.6.** Word-by-word streaming
  animation stays on one timeline, so sibling sections no longer fade in on
  top of each other. The renderer also picks up the 2.6 accessibility and
  download fixes. Long code and tables stay full height, so the transcript
  layout model still matches what you see.
## August 24, 2026 - Bot roster status is quieter (v0.6.7)

- **Unread is one small dot on its conversation row.** Unread rows no longer
  use a blue outline or stronger text. Idle bots no longer show a status chip.
  Working bots use one spinner and keep their latest message preview visible.

## August 24, 2026 - Bot unread state stays quiet (v0.6.6)

- **Unread is now one clear dot.** The highlighted row and stronger text keep
  unread conversations easy to scan without a label that crowds the bot name.
  Working, Idle, and Disabled remain explicit and separate from unread state.

## August 24, 2026 - Bot status and recent conversations stand out (v0.6.5)

- **Bot state is explicit.** Each roster row now labels the bot as Working,
  Idle, or Disabled. Unread conversations have a larger badge, stronger text,
  and a highlighted row. Activity and unread state stay separate, so a bot can
  show both Working and Unread at the same time.
- **The newest bot conversation is first.** The desktop rail and mobile Bots
  page now use the same recency order. Bots with no conversation stay at the
  end.
- **Schedule names have more room on mobile.** The name now has its own line
  instead of sharing a cramped row with the enable switch.

## August 24, 2026 - Chat updates glide instead of jumping (v0.6.4)

- **New messages, tool calls, and the working indicator now move the chat
  smoothly.** A time-based spring follows the live bottom of the transcript.
  Streamed text and tool-status updates no longer cancel that motion and snap
  the view. Changing sessions also no longer paints a provisional transcript
  height that makes the layout flicker before it settles.
- **Computer control now follows the input device.** There is one Take control
  toggle. A mouse points directly, while touch acts like a trackpad. A tap no
  longer blocks the next drag, and agent browser input no longer shows a
  desktop-wide lock that did not protect a shared resource.

## August 24, 2026 - Hosted onboarding answers reach analytics (v0.6.3)

- **The hosted onboarding survey now sends answers through the host.** The
  embedded package previously expected an analytics account at package-build
  time. Release builds do not own one, so the survey event code compiled to a
  no-op. The host now supplies the analytics handler that already identifies
  the signed-in user. Role, friction, daily-tool, AI-tool, completion, and skip
  results can reach the hosted product's existing analytics account.

## August 24, 2026 - The Computer on a phone, and Schedules as a real list (v0.6.2)

- **The Computer survives a restart.** Its lifecycle used to live only in the
  server's memory, so a deploy or a crash left the desktop running with nobody
  holding it: the screen stayed up while the tab went dead, and the next start
  failed because the ports were still taken. A restarted server now reattaches
  to a healthy desktop instead of orphaning it, so a deploy is invisible to
  whoever is watching and to an agent mid-task.
- **Touch works properly.** Dragging moves the pointer by offset, the way a
  trackpad does, instead of teleporting it to wherever your finger landed --
  which on a touchscreen put the target under your own hand. A tap clicks where
  the cursor is. There is a keyboard button, because a canvas cannot take focus
  on iOS and there was previously no way to raise the soft keyboard at all.
- **Opening the Computer starts it.** The Start button is gone: opening the
  page was already the decision, and the progress indicator covers the wait.
- **Schedules is a list you can work.** The enable switch moves to the right
  edge where a thumb already is, the agent icon becomes a quick switch, each
  schedule fits on one line, and the findings banner is gone -- findings have
  their own surface, and a banner about them was the loudest thing on a page
  meant to be a list of schedules.
## August 24, 2026 - Fix the release bundle (v0.6.1)

- **The v0.6.0 release bundle failed to build.** The Computer pulls in noVNC,
  which ships top-level await, and the embedded-library build targeted a browser
  set that predates it. The app build had already been raised; this config was
  missed, so the app was fine and only the release bundle broke.

## August 24, 2026 - The Computer: a desktop you and your agents share (v0.6.0)

- **This box now has a screen you can watch and take over.** The Computer is a
  real desktop -- a window manager, a panel, a file manager, a terminal, and a
  browser -- streamed into the app and controllable from it. Open it from the
  Pages menu, press Take control, and you have the pointer and keyboard. On a
  phone or tablet the usual gestures work: tap to click, two-finger tap for a
  right click, drag to move, two-finger drag to scroll, pinch to zoom.
- **Agents drive the browser on that same screen.** A new Computer Use MCP gives
  them navigate, click, type, press, read and screenshot. Because they work in a
  visible window on the desktop you are watching, you see what they do as they
  do it, rather than reading about it afterwards.
- **Chrome runs headful, not headless.** Headless Chrome announces itself in the
  user agent and is trivially fingerprinted. This is an ordinary browser that
  happens to have no monitor, with a persistent profile, so a site you sign into
  stays signed in and an agent can pick up where you left off.
- **It costs nothing until you ask for it.** No part of the desktop is installed
  by setup, and nothing starts until you press the button. The screen reaches
  the browser over the existing websocket -- no extra proxy process and no new
  runtime dependency.
- **The Computer Use MCP is off by default and separate from the omg MCP.** It
  drives a screen that only exists where the desktop is installed, so it is its
  own catalog with its own switch, next to the omg.dev MCP on the Coding agents
  page rather than buried in Settings.

## August 24, 2026 - Scrolling does what you tell it (v0.5.1)

- **The transcript no longer scrolls itself.** Following the newest message was
  decided by measuring the distance to the bottom on every scroll event. That
  works only while the total height is stable, and it stopped being stable when
  the transcript started keeping only the visible rows in the page: a row that
  comes into view replaces its estimated height with its real one, the total
  moves, and the view could re-pin itself with no new message and no input from
  you. Following is now a stored state that only a real gesture can change.
  Scroll away and it stays away. Scroll back to the bottom, or press New
  activity, and it follows again. A re-measure cannot change it. Nor can a
  prepend, or the page correcting its own position. Keyboard scrolling counts
  as a gesture now, which it did not before.
- **Tool calls send less over the wire.** The arguments of a tool call are no
  longer streamed with the transcript. The name and the count are, which is all
  a collapsed pill shows, and the arguments load when you open one. Measured on
  real sessions this cuts a transcript load by 13 to 31 percent. The trade is
  that opening a pill now waits for one small request.
- **Connection diagnostics are recorded again.** The browser posted five kinds
  of websocket event to a route that had been deleted as unused, so every one
  returned 404 and the client half of the connection record was lost. The route
  is back. Only the browser knows the close code and the retry count, so the
  server could not stand in for it.

## August 24, 2026 - A transcript that stays fast, and can be searched (v0.5.0)

- **Tool-heavy sessions are readable again.** The transcript asked the server for
  80 raw messages, but the screen shows collapsed rows, and one run of tool calls
  collapses into a single pill. A session that was mostly tool work therefore
  arrived as three rows on an otherwise empty screen, and it could not page back,
  because the page did not overflow and the backfill only ran when it did.
  Paging is now measured in rows, so a page always carries enough to read. The
  row rule has one definition that the server and the browser share.
- **A find bar for the transcript.** Virtualization keeps only the rows near the
  viewport in the page, so the browser find command can only see those. Search
  now runs on the server, over the whole session, and jumps to the row that
  matched. It reports how many matches exist, walks forward and backward, and
  keeps loading older pages while it hunts for a match that is not loaded yet.
  It does not take over Control+F, because that would be a hostile default.
- **Sending a message during a reply no longer doubles the reply.** The chat
  library appends a new copy of a message when the incoming update does not
  match the end of the list. Sending mid-reply moved the reply away from the
  end, so a second copy appeared, and the two drew on top of each other. The
  live turn is now kept at the end, and an older copy of it is dropped.
- **Images no longer reload when you scroll back to them.** Off-screen rows are
  removed from the page, so returning to an image used to download it again and
  show the loading pulse again. Images and video now load in the element itself,
  so the browser cache serves them. Video also seeks properly now, instead of
  downloading the whole file first. The hosted surface keeps the previous path,
  because it authenticates with a header.
