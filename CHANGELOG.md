# Changelog

Recent product updates and deployment notes.

## August 25, 2026 - iPhone text selection works normally

- **Long-press uses the native iPhone selection controls again.** A user can
  select and adjust any part of a message, while the separate copy button
  remains available for copying the whole message in one tap.

## August 24, 2026 - Bot roster status is quieter (v0.6.7)

- **Unread is one small dot on its conversation row.** Unread rows no longer
  use a blue outline or stronger text. Idle bots no longer show a status chip.
  Working bots use one spinner and keep their latest message preview visible.

## August 24, 2026 - Bot unread state stays quiet (v0.6.6)

- **Unread is now one clear dot.** The highlighted row and stronger text keep
  unread conversations easy to scan without a label that crowds the bot name.
  Working, Idle, and Disabled remain explicit and separate from unread state.

## August 24, 2026 - Bot status and recent conversations stand out (v0.6.5)

- **Bot state is explicit.** Each roster row now labels the bot as Working,
  Idle, or Disabled. Unread conversations have a larger badge, stronger text,
  and a highlighted row. Activity and unread state stay separate, so a bot can
  show both Working and Unread at the same time.
- **The newest bot conversation is first.** The desktop rail and mobile Bots
  page now use the same recency order. Bots with no conversation stay at the
  end.
- **Schedule names have more room on mobile.** The name now has its own line
  instead of sharing a cramped row with the enable switch.

## August 24, 2026 - Chat updates glide instead of jumping (v0.6.4)

- **New messages, tool calls, and the working indicator now move the chat
  smoothly.** A time-based spring follows the live bottom of the transcript.
  Streamed text and tool-status updates no longer cancel that motion and snap
  the view. Changing sessions also no longer paints a provisional transcript
  height that makes the layout flicker before it settles.
- **Computer control now follows the input device.** There is one Take control
  toggle. A mouse points directly, while touch acts like a trackpad. A tap no
  longer blocks the next drag, and agent browser input no longer shows a
  desktop-wide lock that did not protect a shared resource.

## August 24, 2026 - Hosted onboarding answers reach analytics (v0.6.3)

- **The hosted onboarding survey now sends answers through the host.** The
  embedded package previously expected an analytics account at package-build
  time. Release builds do not own one, so the survey event code compiled to a
  no-op. The host now supplies the analytics handler that already identifies
  the signed-in user. Role, friction, daily-tool, AI-tool, completion, and skip
  results can reach the hosted product's existing analytics account.

## August 24, 2026 - The Computer on a phone, and Schedules as a real list (v0.6.2)

- **The Computer survives a restart.** Its lifecycle used to live only in the
  server's memory, so a deploy or a crash left the desktop running with nobody
  holding it: the screen stayed up while the tab went dead, and the next start
  failed because the ports were still taken. A restarted server now reattaches
  to a healthy desktop instead of orphaning it, so a deploy is invisible to
  whoever is watching and to an agent mid-task.
- **Touch works properly.** Dragging moves the pointer by offset, the way a
  trackpad does, instead of teleporting it to wherever your finger landed --
  which on a touchscreen put the target under your own hand. A tap clicks where
  the cursor is. There is a keyboard button, because a canvas cannot take focus
  on iOS and there was previously no way to raise the soft keyboard at all.
- **Opening the Computer starts it.** The Start button is gone: opening the
  page was already the decision, and the progress indicator covers the wait.
- **Schedules is a list you can work.** The enable switch moves to the right
  edge where a thumb already is, the agent icon becomes a quick switch, each
  schedule fits on one line, and the findings banner is gone -- findings have
  their own surface, and a banner about them was the loudest thing on a page
  meant to be a list of schedules.
## August 24, 2026 - Fix the release bundle (v0.6.1)

- **The v0.6.0 release bundle failed to build.** The Computer pulls in noVNC,
  which ships top-level await, and the embedded-library build targeted a browser
  set that predates it. The app build had already been raised; this config was
  missed, so the app was fine and only the release bundle broke.

## August 24, 2026 - The Computer: a desktop you and your agents share (v0.6.0)

- **This box now has a screen you can watch and take over.** The Computer is a
  real desktop -- a window manager, a panel, a file manager, a terminal, and a
  browser -- streamed into the app and controllable from it. Open it from the
  Pages menu, press Take control, and you have the pointer and keyboard. On a
  phone or tablet the usual gestures work: tap to click, two-finger tap for a
  right click, drag to move, two-finger drag to scroll, pinch to zoom.
- **Agents drive the browser on that same screen.** A new Computer Use MCP gives
  them navigate, click, type, press, read and screenshot. Because they work in a
  visible window on the desktop you are watching, you see what they do as they
  do it, rather than reading about it afterwards.
- **Chrome runs headful, not headless.** Headless Chrome announces itself in the
  user agent and is trivially fingerprinted. This is an ordinary browser that
  happens to have no monitor, with a persistent profile, so a site you sign into
  stays signed in and an agent can pick up where you left off.
- **It costs nothing until you ask for it.** No part of the desktop is installed
  by setup, and nothing starts until you press the button. The screen reaches
  the browser over the existing websocket -- no extra proxy process and no new
  runtime dependency.
- **The Computer Use MCP is off by default and separate from the omg MCP.** It
  drives a screen that only exists where the desktop is installed, so it is its
  own catalog with its own switch, next to the omg.dev MCP on the Coding agents
  page rather than buried in Settings.

## August 24, 2026 - Scrolling does what you tell it (v0.5.1)

- **The transcript no longer scrolls itself.** Following the newest message was
  decided by measuring the distance to the bottom on every scroll event. That
  works only while the total height is stable, and it stopped being stable when
  the transcript started keeping only the visible rows in the page: a row that
  comes into view replaces its estimated height with its real one, the total
  moves, and the view could re-pin itself with no new message and no input from
  you. Following is now a stored state that only a real gesture can change.
  Scroll away and it stays away. Scroll back to the bottom, or press New
  activity, and it follows again. A re-measure cannot change it. Nor can a
  prepend, or the page correcting its own position. Keyboard scrolling counts
  as a gesture now, which it did not before.
- **Tool calls send less over the wire.** The arguments of a tool call are no
  longer streamed with the transcript. The name and the count are, which is all
  a collapsed pill shows, and the arguments load when you open one. Measured on
  real sessions this cuts a transcript load by 13 to 31 percent. The trade is
  that opening a pill now waits for one small request.
- **Connection diagnostics are recorded again.** The browser posted five kinds
  of websocket event to a route that had been deleted as unused, so every one
  returned 404 and the client half of the connection record was lost. The route
  is back. Only the browser knows the close code and the retry count, so the
  server could not stand in for it.

## August 24, 2026 - A transcript that stays fast, and can be searched (v0.5.0)

- **Tool-heavy sessions are readable again.** The transcript asked the server for
  80 raw messages, but the screen shows collapsed rows, and one run of tool calls
  collapses into a single pill. A session that was mostly tool work therefore
  arrived as three rows on an otherwise empty screen, and it could not page back,
  because the page did not overflow and the backfill only ran when it did.
  Paging is now measured in rows, so a page always carries enough to read. The
  row rule has one definition that the server and the browser share.
- **A find bar for the transcript.** Virtualization keeps only the rows near the
  viewport in the page, so the browser find command can only see those. Search
  now runs on the server, over the whole session, and jumps to the row that
  matched. It reports how many matches exist, walks forward and backward, and
  keeps loading older pages while it hunts for a match that is not loaded yet.
  It does not take over Control+F, because that would be a hostile default.
- **Sending a message during a reply no longer doubles the reply.** The chat
  library appends a new copy of a message when the incoming update does not
  match the end of the list. Sending mid-reply moved the reply away from the
  end, so a second copy appeared, and the two drew on top of each other. The
  live turn is now kept at the end, and an older copy of it is dropped.
- **Images no longer reload when you scroll back to them.** Off-screen rows are
  removed from the page, so returning to an image used to download it again and
  show the loading pulse again. Images and video now load in the element itself,
  so the browser cache serves them. Video also seeks properly now, instead of
  downloading the whole file first. The hosted surface keeps the previous path,
  because it authenticates with a header.

## August 23, 2026 - A quieter composer, and Manage sessions is gone (v0.4.0)

- **New: one-shot commands over the API.** `POST /api/exec` runs a single
  shell command in a configured repo and returns its output, exit code and
  timing. It exists for a caller reaching this box from somewhere else — an
  agent on another machine had no way to read a file short of starting a whole
  coding-agent session. Capped deliberately: 60s by default and 120s at most,
  64KB per stream keeping both the start and the end of the output, and the
  working directory must resolve to a repo this computer already knows.
  Anything longer belongs in a session.
- **Requests are size-limited.** A body over 32MB is now rejected with a 413
  instead of being read into memory. Uploads that legitimately pass through
  this server, like session artifact images and videos, are well under it.
- **The chat composer is rebuilt.** The bar gives the text more room without
  growing its buttons, which stay at a full 40px touch target. Send is an arrow
  that only appears once there is something to send. Attach is a plus that moved
  inside the bar. The mic is a real circle, and send sits beside it.
  Hold-to-queue and Cmd/Ctrl+Enter still queue. Voice lives entirely on the mic
  button now: tap to dictate, hold to talk, drag to cancel.
- **Removed: the "/" button in the composer.** Typing "/" still opens the skill
  suggestions, but nothing on screen advertises them any more. That is what the
  composer rework costs, and it is recorded here rather than glossed over.
- **Removed: "Manage sessions".** The submenu is gone, along with the five
  agent-driven templates behind it, the path that launched an agent from one,
  and the clear-idle action. `POST /api/sessions/close-all` went with it,
  because that action was its only caller. Closing a single session is
  untouched, and so is reclaiming an idle one under memory pressure.
- **The transcript glides instead of jumping.** Staying stuck to the bottom used
  to set the scroll position instantly on every change, which raced the entrance
  animations and produced a jump under a still-arriving message. Appends, the
  typing indicator, and re-engaging stick now animate. A message streaming in
  place still snaps, because a smooth scroll cannot keep up with 30ms token
  gaps. A reader who has scrolled up is still left alone.
- **Sending a message no longer stutters the scroll.** Three separate triggers
  fired on send, and each one restarted the eased scroll from zero, so the
  transcript hitched instead of settling. The glide is now started once and
  left to finish. A wheel, a touch, or a pointer press cancels it immediately,
  so the view can no longer pull away from a reader who is scrolling up.
- **The transcript re-renders less while a message streams.** Every arriving
  token re-rendered every message and every tool group in the session. Those
  are now compared before they redraw. On a long streaming session this took
  dropped frames from 81 to 32, and layout recalculations from 1733 to 520.
- **A reclaimed worktree is captured before it is removed.** Session worktrees
  used to be deleted outright. The contents are now committed under
  `refs/wip/<session-id>` first, and the removal is abandoned if that capture
  fails. A worktree is never reclaimed while its tmux pane is alive, while a
  process is running inside it, or while it is still registered, whatever its
  age. The retention window is seven days.
- **Archiving a session stops the dev servers it started.** They used to keep
  running after the session was gone, which is how this machine collected
  orphaned Vite processes. Closing a session now reaps them. A registry row is
  also checked for a live pane before it is deleted, so a resume can no longer
  orphan a session that is still running.
- **The session tree connector is drawn at one weight.** The elbow joining a
  child to its parent used a corner radius scaled off the app's `--radius`, so
  on a 20px connector it ended well short of where the T-junction reached, and
  read lighter because a border-and-radius elbow and a filled spine are drawn by
  two different rasterizers. The connector is a single stroke now, and holds
  even weight on standard and retina displays.
- **A row's preview fades when it changes.** A streaming session rewrites the
  line under its title, and a dozen rows snapping to new words at once made the
  list twitch. The new text now fades in over 220ms without moving, because a
  row that shifts looks like it changed position in the list. Off entirely under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **"Copy session reference" no longer writes LFG on your clipboard.** It put
  `LFG session reference: <id>` there, which is the most public of the
  leftover names, because that string gets pasted into other tools and into
  conversations. The `lfg mcp` command and the `lfg-mcp` settings key are
  deliberately unchanged: one is what agents are already configured to run, and
  the other is where setup state is stored, so renaming them is a migration
  rather than a label fix.
- **Setup names the cause when the command is missing afterwards.** It used to
  report that `lfg` was not on PATH, to someone who had just typed
  `omg computer setup`. It now names the actual fix: open a new shell, or add
  `~/.local/bin` to PATH, then run `omg computer status`.
- **The README says whether the install can run unattended.** It can. Setup has
  no prompts of its own, and every optional feature stays off until you set its
  variable. What it does need is documented now: it refuses to run as root, and
  on Linux it always calls sudo, for `apt-get` and for `loginctl enable-linger`.
  There is also a copy-paste prompt for handing the install to a coding agent.

## August 22, 2026 - One session list, and sessions get their own page (v0.3.0)

- **Mobile and desktop now render the same session list.** Mobile used to show
  a grid of cards, each carrying a whole transcript, split into Working and
  Idle. It shows the desktop rail's rows now: one line of preview, a fixed
  height, and the same delegated-child spine. A row cannot hold a transcript,
  so tapping one opens the session instead of expanding in place.
- **An open session has its own URL.** `/sessions/<id>` is a real page. Back —
  the browser's, the phone's gesture, ours — leaves the session rather than the
  app, and a transcript can be linked to.
- **Folders are the only grouping, and the folder title is the filter.** Click
  a folder heading to scope the list to it. The scoped heading carries a cross
  to come back. Working and Idle are gone: they moved a session between two
  groups every time it started or stopped, which reordered the list to say
  something each row already shows.
- **The folder button is only for folders now.** It used to scope the list and
  add projects at the same time. It opens the folder manager; scoping belongs
  to the heading.
- **Bots have their own surface on both widths.** They are no longer repeated
  inside the Chat list. The roster and the session list share one row
  component, so bot rows gain the swipe gestures and the right-click menu they
  never had. Creating a bot is the first row of the list.
- **A bot conversation opens even when its session is not running.** The
  transcript lives on disk and outlives the process that wrote it. A bot with
  months of history used to look brand new.
- **Thinking says how long it took.** "Thinking… 12s" while it runs, "Thought
  for 12s" after. Thinking that happens between tool calls folds into that run,
  so a turn using six tools reads as one line rather than twelve.
- **Tool calls and the typing indicator lost their cards.** A tool call is a
  line in the transcript, not an object stacked between the sentences.
- **Working is one treatment everywhere.** The agent mark shrinks and an amber
  spinner fills the space around it. The rail and the session header used to
  disagree, in two different colours.
- **The app icon and favicons are the omg.dev mark.** They still drew the
  "lfg" wordmark on a blue tile.
- **Settings is smaller.** Section headers that restated the single row below
  them are gone, and so are descriptions that repeated the control they sat
  under. Version and Updates are one row that expands, and it reports a version
  skew without being expanded. Ping moved to the bottom of More as a plain
  line. Your account picture appears once, not twice.
- **Removed: "Pause new agents" and "Archive idle agents".** Both are gone from
  the interface and from the server. Agent creation is no longer refused by a
  pause flag. An idle agent is now reclaimed only under memory pressure, or by
  the systemd memory bound. Stored values from an older install are ignored
  rather than rejected.
- **The findings feed no longer merges different errors.** Every "React error
  #NNN" collapsed into one row, so a dismissed finding could silently absorb a
  new, unrelated crash. A finding whose fix has landed now says which commit
  fixed it, and resolves itself after two days without recurrence.
- **Attached images are shown, not described.** The composer used to list a
  filename, a byte count and three buttons beside a thumbnail. Click the image
  to annotate or remove it.

## August 22, 2026 - Add to home screen closes the first run (v0.2.23)

- **First-run setup now ends with an optional "Add omg to your home screen"
  page.** It comes after agent connection and the value pitch, never before
  them. On iPhone and Mac Safari it opens the step-by-step install sheet; on
  Chrome and Android it fires the browser's real install prompt.
- **The page can never block anyone.** "Open my Computer" sits directly under
  the install button, and the page only joins the flow on browsers that can
  actually install. Everyone else sees the same flow as before.

## August 21, 2026 - One `omg` for computer setup and create / deploy (v0.2.22)

- **`@omg-dev/cli` 0.5.1 keeps one public `omg` binary.** `0.5.0` rejected
  `create` / `deploy` / `login` after it replaced the vibes 0.4.42 line.
  `@omg-dev/apps` was never published, so a fresh `npm i -g @omg-dev/cli`
  lost those verbs. This version starts the hosted app flow again on the
  same command.
- **`omg computer setup` is still the local control plane.** It still
  installs this repository's runtime and still opens
  http://localhost:8766. You still bring your own agent accounts. omg.dev
  does not resell tokens.
- **`omg create`, `omg deploy`, and `omg login` start the last published
  hosted app CLI (`@omg-dev/cli@0.4.42`).** The user does not type a second
  command. A maintainer can point `OMG_APPS_BIN` at another runner, or put
  `omg-apps` on PATH after `@omg-dev/apps` is published.
- **The published `@omg-dev` package tarballs match the release tag again.**
  `v0.2.21` attached tarballs that were stamped `0.2.20`, because that
  release was built from a branch whose version was not bumped. A host that
  pins `omg-dev-app-<tag>.tgz` could not install from it. This release ships
  `0.2.22` tarballs under the `v0.2.22` tag. The runtime code is the same as
  `v0.2.21`.

## August 20, 2026 - jcode Claude and Codex login in the UI

- **jcode Claude and Codex sign-in now uses the same in-app login as the
  other providers.** The jcode row in Settings lists Claude and Codex.
  Connect opens the existing browser login dialog. It does not send you to
  a terminal-only `jcode login` picker.
- **The real Codex flag is `--provider openai`.** There is no
  `--provider codex`. Claude is `jcode login --provider claude`. The UI
  starts those with `--print-auth-url --json`, then finishes with
  `--auth-code` or `--callback-url`. After that, a jcode session can run
  with the signed-in provider, the same way other signed-in harnesses do.
- omg.dev still drives the jcode CLI you already own. It does not resell
  tokens.
- **When jcode is not installed, Connect starts setup instead of the login
  dialog.** The jcode row shows only the missing CLI check. Helper text is
  "Connect Claude or Codex above." The dialog title says Claude or Codex
  once the CLI is present.

## August 20, 2026 - Coding agent toggles follow readiness

- **A coding agent is on only when it can run.** The Settings list used to
  default every toggle on, even when the CLI was missing or no account was
  connected. A fresh box now shows those agents off, with one word:
  Install or Connect. A ready agent stays on. An agent you turned off stays
  off.
- Turning an unready agent on no longer enables it. The row opens to the
  missing action instead.
- The expanded row no longer repeats the failure, dumps install commands, or
  labels OMG tools. Provider Connect rows and a single Install or Login
  control stay.

## August 20, 2026 - Move an existing schedule onto a bot

- **An auto agent could not be handed to a bot.** A bot-owned routine could
  only be created by the bot itself, from scratch. Moving one of the existing
  schedules to a bot meant retyping its whole prompt and losing its id, run
  history and findings. You can now reassign an existing schedule in place:
  `lfg agents auto assign <id> --bot <botId>`, and `--user` moves it back to
  the headless runner.
- `lfg agents auto list` and `show` now name each schedule's owner. A
  bot-owned routine produces no findings, because its results go to that
  bot's conversation instead, so this is the difference between quiet
  because healthy and quiet because nobody is watching the right surface.
- The per-bot routine cap, the frequency ceiling, and the check that the
  target bot exists and is enabled now apply to any schedule that ends up
  bot-owned, not only to ones a bot created. Re-saving a routine the bot
  already owns no longer trips its own cap.
- Documented which of the existing auto agents can move to which existing
  bot, and which should stay headless, in
  `docs/bot-owned-automations-plan.md`.

## August 20, 2026 - A new account saw no onboarding steps at all (v0.2.20)

- **A brand new hosted account landed on an empty home screen.** After
  finishing (or skipping) the connect screens, there was nothing on the page
  that said what the Computer could do: no steps, no suggestions, only "No
  running sessions". The first-run steps existed on the server the whole
  time, but no screen ever showed them. There is now a "Getting started"
  panel on the home screen with the remaining steps. It can be dismissed, it
  stays dismissed on every device, and Settings > Setup guide replays it.
- Each step completes on its own when you do the thing, so the panel never
  asks you to start a first session while you are looking at one.
- **A shared persistent-bot conversation's header showed a human avatar and
  name chip** next to the bot's own identity, reading as who created or owns
  the bot. The header now shows only the bot's identity and settings.
- **Messages from other people in a shared bot conversation now show whose
  they are.** A verified message from someone other than you shows their
  avatar and name beside it, like a group chat inside the bot conversation.
  Your own messages and the bot's replies look exactly as they did before.

## August 20, 2026 - Opening a bot from the roster could show the wrong chat surface (v0.2.19)

- **Selecting a persistent bot on the desktop layout could render a plain
  session instead of the bot's own chat.** The header showed a generic agent
  icon and model badge instead of the bot's avatar and settings, and the
  composer read "Add a note" instead of the bot's name. The bot the roster
  resolved is now trusted for the whole surface — header, composer, and
  message routing — instead of being re-derived from data that could lag
  behind a rotated, nested, or same-named session.
- **The bot chat back button on mobile is now a single chevron**, dropping
  the "Bots" label text (still announced as "Back to bots" for screen
  readers).
- **Bot replies are chat-shaped instead of essay-shaped.** Short replies,
  separate message beats, confident framing, and no more bolded lead-ins,
  markdown headings, bulleted recaps, or "want me to do X or Y?" closers.
- **A session with a dead harness can be resumed again.** Two bugs combined
  to make some dead sessions permanently stuck: a liveness check misread pid
  0 as "running," and the resume endpoint trusted that same misread to skip
  restarting them. Messages sent to a stuck session now reach a running
  process again.
- **Fewer "database is locked" errors during heavy concurrent use.**
  Transcript search no longer maintains a full-text mirror of every message;
  it now scans the same per-session index search already needed, which
  removed a second write on every message ingested while the write lock was
  held.

## August 20, 2026 - Persistent bot chats can restart their runtime (v0.2.18)

- **A persistent bot conversation now has an explicit Restart session action.**
  It replaces the execution runtime while it keeps the same conversation ID,
  route, transcript, participants, verified authors, unread state, and queued
  messages. The action is separate from Apply changes, Stop, automatic context
  refresh, and starting a fresh conversation.
- **Restart waits for a safe lifecycle boundary.** Active primary work, child
  work, and queued messages defer the restart. A per-bot lock and runtime
  compare-and-swap prevent duplicate replacements. Failed staging or shutdown
  restores the old primary when it remains usable.
- **The action is limited to the persistent bot conversation menu.** Verified
  shared-Computer access uses the existing bot control policy. Regular session
  and child task controls and APIs are unchanged.

## August 20, 2026 - Codex sessions could not start after a Computer update (v0.2.17)

- **Release bundles contain the Codex runtime again.** The bundle removed
  `@openai/codex` to save space, because a coding agent runtime is expected to
  come from the CLI on your own machine. The Codex backend does not use a
  global CLI. It uses the runtime that the SDK pins, unless you set
  `LFG_CODEX_PATH`. A Computer that updated to a recent release could therefore
  not start any Codex session, and reported "Unable to locate Codex CLI
  binaries". Scheduled agents that use Codex failed for the same reason.
  Bundles are approximately 336 MB larger.
- **A Codex session that goes silent now stops with a clear reason.** If the
  Codex process stopped during a turn, the event stream could stop without an
  error. The session stayed busy, gave no reason, and did not answer new
  messages. Interrupt could not stop it. The session now ends the turn, writes
  the reason in the transcript, keeps the conversation, and accepts the next
  message.

## August 20, 2026 - Persistent bots rotate without losing the conversation (v0.2.16)

- **Persona and runtime changes now start a fresh model runtime instead of
  appending another launch prompt to the old thread.** The bot editor shows an
  explicit Apply action and reports queued, refreshing, current, and failed
  states. One durable conversation ID keeps the route, transcript, unread
  state, shared participants, and verified message authors stable while the
  primary runtime changes beneath it.
- **Long-lived bots now refresh before measured context use reaches the model
  limit.** Automatic refresh defaults to 78 percent, can be disabled or set
  from 40 to 95 percent in Settings, and uses hysteresis plus a minimum interval
  to prevent loops. The server waits for active primary work, child sessions,
  and queued messages before it rotates.
- **Each replacement receives a bounded, structured continuity checkpoint.**
  The checkpoint keeps explicit goals, decisions, open tasks, preferences,
  artifacts, verified human authors, and `legacy:unknown` attribution without
  copying secrets or old runtime contracts. Revision compare-and-swap and the
  per-bot lock prevent duplicate rotations. A failed stage or close restores
  the still-live old primary and exposes the error for retry.

## August 20, 2026 - Persistent bot quotas are owner-aware and default to 20 (v0.2.15)

- **Each verified owner can store 20 persistent bots by default.** Disabled and
  idle bots count because they remain stored. Ownerless legacy bots stay in a
  separate pool and do not consume a personal allowance. The API returns a
  structured quota snapshot, and the bot editor shows current usage and a clear
  limit state. This quota is separate from the live-agent admission limit.
- **Managed Computers use trusted viewer identity for quota attribution.** A
  host-provided `persistentBotLimit` entitlement overrides the local
  `LFG_PERSISTENT_BOT_LIMIT`, which overrides the default of 20. The default
  works without a host change. Plan-specific limits require the host to write
  `persistentBotLimit` into the trusted entitlement.

## August 20, 2026 - The hosted Computer/Settings switcher could float over the page instead of docking (v0.2.14)

- **On a host running `@omg-dev/app`'s native mount (`app.omg.dev`) at a
  tablet-portrait or narrow-desktop width (roughly 768-1023px), the host's
  Computer/Settings pill lost its usual anchor point and fell back to
  floating a differently-styled pill over the top of the page** — visible as
  a small, foreign-looking capsule overlapping other chrome. LFG's embedded
  header renders a `data-lfg-host-slot="header-actions"` node the host docks
  into at every breakpoint; that node existed on the mobile header (<768px)
  and the desktop rail footer (>=1024px) but was missing from the one header
  branch in between. The generic/tablet header now carries the same slot and
  host-settings capability flag as the mobile header. See
  `docs/hosted-shell-inventory.md` for the full shell inventory and root
  cause. Ships to the hosted product once `vibes` bumps its `@omg-dev/app`
  pin past this release.

## August 20, 2026 - The desktop Chat/Bots switch could disappear after selecting a bot (v0.2.13)

- **On desktop, opening a bot's conversation hid the Chat/Bots switch bar in
  the rail, with no way back to the session list short of a reload.** A fix
  that correctly took the switch out of the mobile full-screen bot chat (once
  that view got its own "Back to bots" button, making the switch redundant
  there) copied the same `selectedBotId` guard onto the desktop rail's own
  switch. Desktop never gets that full-screen takeover — the rail keeps
  showing the roster regardless of which bot or session is open in the stage
  — so the guard just stranded desktop users on the Bots surface. The desktop
  rail now always renders its switch; mobile's behavior is unchanged.

## August 20, 2026 - A selected bot could render as a plain session

- **A persistent bot's chat could show the plain session header instead of
  the bot's own avatar, settings button, and composer.** The bot resolution
  shared by the server and the web client trusted a bot's saved session id as
  soon as a live, non-delegated session existed at that id — without checking
  that session actually belonged to the bot. A stale saved id, or an ordinary
  session that later reused the same id, was enough to make the roster point
  at someone else's session, and the bot's identity dropped silently because
  the render path read `botId` straight off that unrelated session record.
  `findBotMainSession`, `botConversationRef`, and `botCanonicalSessionId`
  (`src/bots/session.ts`) now require the found session to carry the bot's
  own id before they trust it. The desktop stage column also stamps the
  selected bot's identity onto its rendered session directly, instead of
  trusting whatever `botId` (if any) the raw session record carries.

## August 20, 2026 - First-run installs the local control plane (v0.2.12)

- **The documented install no longer goes through the retired `@omg-dev/cli`
  0.4.x line.** That package is published from `BennyKok/vibes` and is the old
  prompt-to-app CLI (`create` / `deploy` to `*.omgs.app`). A new user who
  followed the previous README got that CLI, and often two `omg` binaries.
  The README first command is now this repository's `scripts/setup.sh`. After
  setup, open http://localhost:8766.
- **This repository now owns `@omg-dev/cli` starting at 0.5.0.** That version
  is required because 0.4.42 is already `latest` on npm; publishing 0.2.x would
  not replace it. The new package only installs and forwards to the local
  control plane. It rejects `create` / `deploy`. `lfg` stays a compatibility
  alias. A release after this change must publish 0.5.0, and `BennyKok/vibes`
  must stop publishing 0.4.x onto the same name.
- **Hosted one-click points at `/sandbox/templates/omg` and `omg serve`.**
  `lfg` remains a compatibility alias for the same product.

## August 20, 2026 - See which versions you are actually running (v0.2.11)

- **Settings shows the app build and the Computer's runtime side by side.**
  Settings > Computer now has two rows, `Frontend` and `Computer`. The first is
  the version of the app you are looking at right now; the second is the
  version the selected Computer is really executing. Tap either to copy it.
  When they disagree, a short line under them says which side is behind. This
  is what you read to tell whether an update actually reached the box.
- **The two numbers cannot agree by accident.** They are read from two separate
  places: the app build stamps its own version at build time, and the Computer
  value only ever comes from that Computer's own reply. Neither one falls back
  to the other, so a matching pair is real evidence and not an assumption.
- **Honest when it does not know.** A Computer that cannot be reached reads
  `Disconnected`, and one running a version too old to report itself reads
  `Unavailable`. Neither shows a guessed number. Self-hosted installs are
  unchanged.
- **The Computer row keeps up with restarts and machine switches.** Updating and
  restarting a Computer used to leave the old version on screen until you
  reloaded the page, which is the one moment the number has to be right. It now
  corrects itself. Switching to a different Computer no longer shows the
  previous machine's version under the new machine's name.
- **Fixed: everyone with access to a shared Computer can see and open that
  Computer's bots again.**

## August 19, 2026 - One row per bot, and faster bot chats (v0.2.10)

- **The Bots list shows each bot once.** A bot that had handed work to a
  background session appeared two or three times, and each duplicate was
  captioned with that background session's last line rather than the bot's. A
  background session inherits the bot's identity for attribution, and both the
  API and the list treated it as its own conversation. The list is now built
  from one canonical conversation for each bot, decided by the server, and a
  background session can never become a row. If a bot's saved conversation had
  been rebound to one of its background sessions, that binding is repaired to
  the original conversation, so the history comes back instead of a background
  task's thread.
- **Unread dots follow the same single conversation.** The dot on a row, and
  the aggregate dot on the Chat/Bots switch, come from that bot's own
  conversation only. Opening a bot still clears that one conversation and no
  others.
- **Bot chats open faster.** Opening a bot waited on a read receipt and then a
  full rebuild of the list before the messages could be served, and the list
  re-opened a live channel for every bot conversation each time any bot
  replied. The receipt is now written behind the paint, and the channels stay
  put unless the set of conversations actually changes.

## August 19, 2026 - Unread bot conversations, and a calmer transcript (v0.2.9)

- **Bot conversations now show unread activity, and it survives a reload.** A
  quiet dot marks each conversation with a new bot reply, with one aggregate dot
  on the Chat/Bots switch and the desktop bot rail. Read state is stored per
  user and per conversation on the server, so it follows you between reloads and
  devices. Your own messages never mark a conversation unread, and a message
  from another bot marks only the conversation it arrived in. Opening a
  conversation clears that one conversation and no others.
- **An open bot conversation no longer carries the Chat/Bots switch.** The
  switch belongs to the bot list and the Live list. Inside a conversation it sat
  above the composer and took a row away from the messages, so it is gone; the
  header Back button is the way out.
- **Replies sit together again instead of drifting apart.** The per-message copy
  button used to reserve an empty row under every turn, which pushed consecutive
  messages about 36px apart and flashed a stray band on hover. It now sits in
  the margin beside its own message, so the gap is 8px between messages from the
  same speaker and 18px when the speaker changes, and revealing it shifts
  nothing.
- **Settings no longer shows the "Who's on this machine" row.** The local
  facepile was showing machine accounts rather than anything you manage, so it
  has been removed along with the endpoint behind it.

## August 19, 2026 - Agents stop filling RAM-backed /tmp (v0.2.8)

- **Agent temp files go to disk when `/tmp` is tmpfs.** Leftover bun installs
  and checkouts in RAM-backed `/tmp` filled 7.8G on one box, which then stalled
  in memory reclaim and looked like a CPU melt. Serve and every agent launch
  now use `~/.cache/lfg/tmp` (or `LFG_TMPDIR`) so those files cost disk, not
  RAM.
- **Unused leftovers in tmpfs `/tmp` are swept.** Entries older than two hours
  with no open process are removed. Live names such as `lfg-uploads`, Claude
  caches, tmux, and ssh sockets stay. The disk cache is swept after a day.

## August 19, 2026 - An affected bot shows its own history right away (v0.2.7)

- **A bot whose chat had been taken over by one of its tasks now recovers its
  real conversation as soon as you open it.** Before, the chat waited until the
  next message to show the right thread.

## August 19, 2026 - A bot can no longer be replaced by its own task (v0.2.6)

- **A bot chat always shows the bot's own conversation.** When a bot's chat
  process ended while one of its background tasks kept running, the bot could be
  permanently rebound to that task. Its chat then opened the task instead, new
  messages waited behind work that was never yours, and there was no way back to
  the real conversation. A bot now keeps its own thread, and a bot already
  affected recovers its full history on the next message.
- **The mobile bot chat has a Back button again.** The chat opens as a full
  screen, so the switch above the composer was the only exit. The header now
  returns you straight to the bot list.

## August 19, 2026 - Bot switch stays above the composer (v0.2.5)

- **The mobile Chat/Bots switch no longer floats over bot messages.** It now
  occupies real layout space directly above the bot composer.

## August 19, 2026 - Bot channel media stays in chat (v0.2.4)

- **Images and videos sent back through a bot's originating channel now also
  appear in the bot chat.** The media joins the same ordered transcript, and a
  delivery retry updates the existing row instead of adding a duplicate.

## August 19, 2026 - Custom user icons and a machine facepile (v0.2.3)

- **You can now upload your own icon in Settings.** PNG, JPEG, WebP, or GIF,
  up to 5MB, instead of relying on your Gravatar. Replacing or removing it
  takes effect immediately, with no stale cached copy lingering.
- **Settings now shows who is on this machine.** A new "Who's on this
  machine" row displays a facepile of everyone sharing this machine — or the
  one account it is paired to — each with their own icon.

## August 19, 2026 - Bot chats keep root mobile navigation (v0.2.2)

- **A selected bot chat now stays at the mobile root.** The header no longer
  shows a Back button, and the compact Chat/Bots switch remains available above
  the composer so Bots returns directly to the flat bot list.

## August 19, 2026 - Mobile bot navigation stays in its lane (v0.2.1)

- **Chat and Bots now have separate mobile lists.** Chat shows coding sessions,
  while Bots shows one persistent row per bot without delegated child tasks.
- **Opening a bot now always opens its main conversation.** A background task
  can no longer take the place of the bot's saved thread.
- **The mobile Chat/Bots switch now sits above the composer.** The compact,
  labeled control frees header space and keeps both destinations within thumb
  reach, with a reduced-motion mode for the sliding indicator.

## August 19, 2026 - Bots can schedule themselves (v0.2.0)

- **A bot can now set up its own recurring check.** Ask it to check something
  every morning, and it schedules a routine on itself with `omg_schedule_routine`
  — no trip through the web UI. When it fires, the bot gets a message in the
  same conversation and does the checking itself, in its own voice, then
  replies like it would to anything else. It can list its own schedules and
  remove one just as easily.
- **Every schedule now says who it belongs to** — you, or a named bot — and the
  Schedules page and each bot's own settings show it. A bot's chat header
  carries a small "Schedules" count too.
- **A bot is capped at 5 self-scheduled routines by default**, configurable in
  Settings, and a schedule that would fire more than roughly every 30 minutes
  is rejected outright — a runaway bot cannot spam itself into a corner.
- **Fixed: a bot could edit or delete another bot's — or your own — schedule.**
  The generic schedule tools had no ownership check at all; a bot's tools are
  now restricted to its own rows, enforced on the server, not just by which
  tool it happens to call.
- **Deleting a bot now cleans up after itself**, removing any routines it
  owned instead of leaving them behind with nothing to deliver to.
- **Fixed: a bot's reply could show up twice.** If a turn was still streaming
  when the tab went to the background, the half-written bubble stuck around
  next to the finished one when you came back.
- **Bot chats are tighter to read.** Messages from the same speaker now sit
  close together, with breathing room only when the speaker changes, instead
  of the same wide gap everywhere.
- **Fixed: a short message could break mid-word.** A one-word reply like
  "Waiting." was squeezed into a bubble narrower than the word itself.
- **Fixed: paused-session guidance now matches the agent you are actually
  running**, instead of showing instructions for a different provider.

## August 19, 2026 - Bots can send secure messages to each other (v0.1.411)

- **Your bots can now coordinate without exposing their private setup.** A bot
  can send a durable message only to another enabled bot that you own. The
  receiving bot sees the verified sender, while private instructions and
  credentials stay out of the message.
- **Replies stay explicit and bounded.** A reply keeps its conversation link,
  stops after four handoffs, and never forwards model output automatically.
  Each bot can send at most ten peer messages per minute.
- **Messages keep their order through restarts.** The queue stores every
  accepted message before delivery and keeps audit details for both accepted
  and rejected attempts.

## August 19, 2026 - Bots can manage themselves, and mobile puts them first (v0.1.410)

- **Bots can safely update their own profile and create a new bot.** The server
  derives ownership from the running bot session, limits each owner to ten
  bots, and never accepts credentials, runtime control or another bot's
  identity through these tools.
- **Chat and Bot are now one tap apart on mobile.** The pinned switch matches
  the desktop rail, and the Bots page now uses a compact, flat roster with one
  clear New bot row.
- **A bot conversation now keeps the bot's own face in its mobile header.** A
  normal coding-agent icon appears only when the session is not owned by a
  resolved bot.
- **Mobile message bubbles no longer show a duplicate copy icon.** Long press
  still opens Copy and Select text, while mouse hover and keyboard focus keep
  the desktop control available.

## August 19, 2026 - Cursor stops asking before every tool (v0.1.409)

- **A Cursor session gets on with the work.** It used to stop and ask you to
  approve tool calls one at a time, so a session you left running would sit
  there waiting on a question instead of finishing. Cursor now runs the same
  way every other agent here already did, and it does it without a terminal
  pane in the background.

## August 19, 2026 - Your bot remembers the conversation (v0.1.408)

- **A bot that goes away and comes back still has your chat.** Its history used
  to vanish: a restart, a reboot or a crash gave the bot a new conversation,
  and everything you had said to it was orphaned. The conversation now belongs
  to the bot rather than to whichever process happened to be running it, so it
  picks up exactly where you left off — and on the default provider the bot
  itself remembers the thread too, instead of being handed a summary of it.
- **The roster shows what your bot last said, even when it is not running.** A
  bot with months of history could greet you with "Say hi to get started"
  simply because nothing was awake to ask.
- **Fixed: some bots could not be typed to at all once their session ended.**
  The composer was waiting for a running process — the one your message was
  about to start.
- **A background task's report now says which task it is from**, so a bot
  running two of them can tell you which one finished.

## August 19, 2026 - The bot's face shows up when something is happening (v0.1.407)

- **Fixed: bot messages sat oddly indented.** Space was being reserved beside
  every reply for the bot's face, including the replies that did not show one,
  so the whole column was pushed right with nothing in the gap.
- **The face appears in one place now: while the bot is working.** It used to
  mark the first reply of every run, which put a row of faces down the chat and
  read as several speakers rather than one bot — and the header already tells
  you who you are talking to. Down in the conversation it now says the thing
  the header cannot: this is happening right now.
- **And it is bigger there** — 40px, up from 30.

## August 19, 2026 - Vercel fx joins the roster (v0.1.406)

- **fx is a supported coding agent.** Vercel Labs' fx runs as a full session
  like any other agent: durable resume, the omg.dev MCP toolset, permission
  prompts in the dashboard, and scheduled auto-agent runs. It is driven over
  its native ACP server, the same route Grok and Cursor already use.
- **Sign in from the browser, not a terminal.** `fx login` is a Vercel device
  flow, so the fx card offers the same one-time-code sign-in as Claude, Codex
  and Grok, instead of Cursor's terminal-only login.
- **The whole gateway catalog, useful models first.** The picker reads the live
  Vercel AI Gateway list — 229 models — and leads with a curated slice. `auto`
  keeps whatever `~/.fx/settings.json` already selects.
- **Know what fx bills.** Every fx credential resolves to Vercel AI Gateway, so
  running `anthropic/claude-opus-5` under fx spends Gateway credit rather than a
  Claude subscription. Claude, Codex and Cursor stay the subscription-backed
  agents. Attach your own provider keys with Vercel BYOK to bill those instead.

## August 19, 2026 - Stale session branches can be cleaned up (v0.1.405)

- **New `omg projects status` and `omg projects clean`.** The worktree sweeper
  removes a session's directory but leaves its Git branch behind, and those
  accumulate: across the projects on this box there are over 600 stale session
  branches and 627 ownership markers. `status` reports what is removable and
  changes nothing. `clean` removes only session branches already contained in
  that project's local `main`, worktree records whose directories are gone, and
  ownership markers whose directories are gone. It keeps unmerged and
  checked-out branches, and never touches working files.
- This work was written and tested two days ago, was reported as finished, and
  then sat unmerged on an abandoned branch. It has now been recovered onto
  main — which is the class of problem the shipping gate above exists to
  prevent.

## August 19, 2026 - A session cannot ship work it never committed (v0.1.404)

- **Shipping now refuses when the code is not in.** A session with uncommitted
  files, or with commits that never reached main, cannot post to Shipped at
  all. It gets told which branch, how many files or commits, and what to do
  about it. Previously only omg.dev's own repo was checked, so sessions in
  every other project could post a finished result while the work sat in a
  dirty worktree — and there was no way to tell those posts apart from real
  ones.
- **Sessions with no code still ship freely.** Operations, research, deploys
  and plain conversations have nothing to land, and the gate never fires on
  them. It only blocks work that exists and did not land.
- Every post also records the branch and commit it was made from, so a result
  can be traced back to the code long after the session is gone. Refusals are
  logged too.

## August 19, 2026 - A bot chat shows the conversation, not the machinery (v0.1.403)

- **Tool calls, their results and reasoning blocks no longer appear in a bot
  chat.** It was still the session log with a chat bubble drawn on it: every
  bash line the bot ran scrolled past in the middle of it answering you. A bot
  chat is a conversation now. What the bot handed you stays — words, images,
  video, dashboards.
- **The header is the bot.** Its face, its name, its persona and the settings
  gear. Gone: the model chip (which harness it runs on is a session detail),
  the actions menu offering fork, close and archive (a bot session is not
  closed from the UI — deleting the bot is), and the floating "files changed /
  Review" bar.
- **Nothing is lost.** A bot's session is still an ordinary session: open it
  from the sessions rail and the whole log is there, tools and reasoning
  included. Heavy work does not run in the chat any more either — it runs in a
  background session with its own row in the fleet.
## August 19, 2026 - Hosted questions have a visible inbox button (v0.1.402)

- **Hosted omg.dev now shows the question button when an agent needs input.**
  The button opens the Notifications inbox. The hosted layout still keeps
  self-hosted update controls out of the host-owned chrome.

## August 19, 2026 - Existing hosted questions return to the inbox (v0.1.401)

- **Questions created before v0.1.400 now appear again.** The inbox recovers an
  older question through its assigned session when the question itself has no
  user. It still hides questions owned by another user and questions with no
  owner at all.

## August 19, 2026 - Questions stay visible, and shipped work shows its code state (v0.1.400)

- **Fixed: a question from a hosted coding agent could disappear.** The shared
  agent server kept the session id but lost the assigned user, so the signed-in
  question feed filtered the question out. Questions now inherit the owner of
  the session that asked them.
- **Shipped posts now show whether their code is committed and landed.** Each
  post records its branch, commit, uncommitted files, and commits that have not
  reached the base branch. Research and operations work can still ship without
  code, but the feed no longer implies that every result is committed.

## August 19, 2026 - Bots hold a conversation, and the work happens in the background (v0.1.399)

- **A bot answers you in the turn you asked.** Ask one a plain question and it
  used to do a coding agent's entire job before saying anything: one spent four
  minutes on 25+ tool calls, picked up an unrelated status skill, went reading
  production databases, and only then replied with a status report. A bot is a
  conversation, so its instructions now say so — answer first, keep it short,
  look things up briefly, and stay inside your own repo.
- **Anything bigger goes to a background session, and that session reports back
  into the chat.** The bot says in one line what it is handing off, ends its
  turn, and tells you what happened in its own words when the work lands. The
  machinery stays out of the conversation.
- **Fixed: a background session's report could be lost completely.** If the
  bot's session had gone away — a reboot, a memory reclaim — the report was
  dropped on the floor, the work was never mentioned, and the task session was
  left running forever holding a slot. The report now brings the bot back and
  gets delivered.
- **Fixed: background updates cut the bot off mid-reply.** They now wait their
  turn. You keep the right to interrupt it yourself.
- **Fixed: a bot could be shut down to make room for another session**, despite
  being the one kind of session that is meant to stay. Coming back gave it a
  new session, so your chat history with it looked empty.
- **Fixed: raw internal reports showed up in your chat with a bot**, in the
  message list and in the roster preview, as though you had typed them.
- **A bot's replies now sit in a bubble, with its face on the first message of
  each run** — so the chat reads as talking to someone rather than reading a
  log. Your side is unchanged.

## August 19, 2026 - The bot's face leads its own editor (v0.1.398)

- **The avatar preview on the bot page is now the size of the thing you are
  choosing.** It was a 56px thumbnail beside the name field, with shape and
  colour rows underneath picking details too small to actually see. It now
  leads the page at 112px, centred, with the name field full width below it.

## August 18, 2026 - Connecting a coding agent shows you a dialog, not a browser tab (v0.1.397)

- **Fixed: the sign-in tab still opened on `about:blank` before redirecting.**
  The previous release stopped that tab from being empty, but the address bar
  still read `about:blank` for the whole wait, because writing a page into a
  tab does not change its URL. Pressing Connect now opens a **dialog** instead,
  right on the click, with its own "Preparing your sign-in link…" state while
  your Computer starts the provider CLI. When the link is ready the dialog
  offers a button, and that button opens the provider directly — the correct
  address from the first frame, with no redirect.
- **The sign-in can no longer be eaten by a pop-up blocker.** The tab is now
  opened by your own click on that button, instead of by code running after a
  network round trip, which is the case browsers block.
- **Instructions are where you are looking.** The one-time code, the paste
  field and the approval spinner all live in the dialog, so a login that fails
  says so on the screen you are on rather than behind a window that took focus.

## August 18, 2026 - Making a bot is a page now (v0.1.396)

- **Creating or editing a bot is a real page with its own URL** (`/bots/new`,
  `/bots/<id>/edit`) instead of a sheet drawn over the bots list. It was made
  full height, then edge to edge, but it was still a drawer the browser had
  never heard of: the phone's back gesture skipped past it to whatever page
  came before the list, and the form could not be linked to or reloaded. Back
  now leaves the editor, forward returns to it, and saving a bot's settings
  drops you back into that bot's chat rather than on the list.
- **Delete moved off the header row** to the bottom of the form, out from
  under the thumb that reaches for Save.
- Fixed: deleting a bot from its settings left you sitting on the editor for a
  bot that no longer existed.

## August 18, 2026 - The hosted "⋮" menu actually gets its Settings entry (v0.1.395)

- **Fixed: the Settings entry added to the hosted "⋮" menu in v0.1.393 never
  appeared.** The menu item, and the flag that tells a host its own Settings
  gear is now redundant, were both gated on an `onOpenHostSettings` callback —
  but `OmgAppSurface` never accepted that prop, so no host could supply one. It
  was reachable from inside the surface and unreachable from outside it. The
  surface now takes the callback and passes it down, so hosted mobile shows
  Settings in the menu and hosts can drop their own control instead of sitting
  at three chips in one island for two destinations.

## August 18, 2026 - Making a bot takes the whole screen (v0.1.394)

- **Creating or editing a bot now fills the phone screen edge to edge.** It was
  already full height, but still drawn as a rounded card inset from every edge
  with a drag handle on top, so it read as a sheet sitting on the app rather
  than a screen of its own. Desktop keeps the centred dialog.

## August 18, 2026 - Settings goes where Settings went (v0.1.393)

- **Fixed: Settings in the hosted "⋮" menu opened the machine's settings**, a
  per-computer page with a machine picker, instead of the app settings the
  gear used to open. The menu now uses a separate host callback for the
  settings root; the machine pages keep their own, for deep links like the
  coding-agent picker.
- **The machine switcher now sits before the "⋮" menu** in the hosted island.
  An overflow menu ahead of the control people actually reach for read as the
  main event.

## August 18, 2026 - A new install could not start a session, and never said why (v0.1.392)

- **Fixed: on a fresh install, sending a message showed the thinking dots
  forever.** The session was not slow — it was already dead. The agent harness
  could not start and exited having printed nothing at all: no output, no
  transcript, no error. A session with no agent connected now says so, and
  points at Settings → Coding agents instead of spinning.
- **Fixed: a session whose agent died then vanished from the list entirely**,
  taking the explanation with it. A dead session that recorded a reason stays
  visible and reports what happened.
- **New: `omg doctor`.** One command that prints a pasteable summary of this
  install — version, which agent CLIs exist, which accounts are connected,
  whether the server answers, and recent errors — for bug reports. It runs
  even when omg.dev is broken, and strips keys, tokens, and your home
  directory so the output is safe to post in public.
- **New: the documented quick start is tested on a genuinely clean machine.**
  `scripts/test-install-clean-vm.sh` runs the README's install on a fresh VM
  and checks the UI actually serves. It found a real break: the published CLI
  needed Node, which the documented `bun install` never installs, so
  `omg computer setup` died on the first command a new user runs.

## August 18, 2026 - Two controls in the corner, not three (v0.1.391)

- **The hosted mobile menu is tidier.** Settings now lives inside the "⋮" menu
  instead of taking its own chip beside it, so the island carries two controls
  for two destinations. On a hosted surface the item opens the host's own
  settings, and it only appears when the host actually mounts those pages.

## August 18, 2026 - Host chrome stays in its corner (v0.1.390)

- **Fixed: on a hosted phone, Bots/Notifications/Artifacts moved the app's
  Computer and Settings buttons to the top-left**, fused onto the end of the
  "Live" back button. Yesterday's island merge landed them correctly on Live
  and incorrectly everywhere else; they now stay in the top-right corner on
  every page.

## August 18, 2026 - One island in the corner, not two (v0.1.389)

- **Fixed: on a hosted phone, the app's own chrome overlapped ours** in the
  top-right corner. The two were kept apart by a hand-maintained width
  constant shared across two repos; it drifted, and they collided. The header
  now offers the host a slot to render into, so there is one island and no gap
  to keep in sync. Hosts that still float their own chrome are unaffected.
- **Fixed: a bot card on mobile no longer wears an idle dot.** The creature
  already shows what the bot is doing; the dot said it again, and said "idle"
  for every bot you simply were not talking to.
- **A host can see when this box is waiting on a browser login**, so it can say
  so instead of looking stuck.

## August 18, 2026 - Connecting a coding agent no longer opens a blank page (v0.1.388)

- **Fixed: "Connect Claude" during Computer first-run opened a blank tab.**
  The sign-in tab has to be opened inside the click (browsers only trust it
  there), but the sign-in link itself takes a server round trip — starting the
  provider CLI and reading the link out of its output. The tab was parked on
  `about:blank` for that entire wait, which is several seconds on a Computer
  that just booted. The tab now opens with its own page, showing a spinner and
  "Opening Claude sign in…", and turns into the provider's page the moment the
  link arrives. Same fix for Codex, Grok, GitHub and pi's providers.
- **A login that cannot start now says so where you are looking.** It used to
  close the tab and put the reason on the page behind it — behind the popup
  that had just taken focus — so a failure was indistinguishable from a blank
  tab that vanished. The reason is now printed in the tab itself.

## August 18, 2026 - Bots stay recognizable everywhere, even before they load (v0.1.387)

- **Fixed: a bot's chat header briefly showed the generic Claude mark instead
  of its own face.** If the bot directory hadn't finished loading yet, the
  header fell all the way back to the default harness icon even though the
  session was clearly bot-driven. It now shows a neutral creature placeholder
  instead of a mark that names the wrong agent.
- **Fixed: no way to create a bot from mobile web when embedded.** The Pages
  menu that leads to Bots was fully hidden on embedded mobile, with no
  substitute, so there was no path to a "New bot" button at all. A trimmed
  Pages menu is back in the embedded mobile header.

## August 18, 2026 - Bots look like bots in the list (v0.1.386)

- **A bot-backed row now wears the bot's face.** It used to show the harness
  mark at full size with the creature shrunk to a 14px corner badge, so a row
  named "Scout" was a Claude mark with a dot on it and looked like every other
  session. The creature is the avatar now, slightly larger than a harness mark
  so the two weigh the same, and it carries working in its own posture instead
  of wearing a busy dot on top.
- **Bots are their own category**, above the fleet in the rail and on mobile,
  and out of the project groups. They are not part of the working/idle split:
  that describes work in flight, and a bot you have not spoken to in a week is
  not idle in that sense.

## August 17, 2026 - Short replies read like sentences again (v0.1.385)

- **Fixed: a short assistant reply wrapped its last word onto its own line.**
  "Hi Benny!" rendered as "Hi" / "Benny!". The bubble was capped at 92% twice
  over, and the inner cap resolved against the text's own width, so any reply
  that fit on one line was forced onto two. Long replies were quietly losing
  8% of the pane to the same bug. Most visible in bot chats, because that is
  where one-line answers are normal.
- **Making or editing a bot opens full height on mobile.** It is a form with an
  autofocused name field, so it no longer starts as a short card that the
  keyboard shoves around before it grows. Desktop keeps the centred dialog.

## August 17, 2026 - Bot Mode: agents you talk to (v0.1.384)

- **Bots are persistent agents you keep a conversation with**, beside the
  sessions you launch and close. A bot has a name, a persona, one long-lived
  chat and a face. You don't launch it, you talk to it. Create one from the
  rail's Bot list; it picks a repo, an agent and a model like a session does.
- **A bot lives in the rail, next to your sessions.** The Chat/Bot switch sits
  under "New session" and changes which list the rail shows. Picking a bot
  opens its chat in the main pane exactly like opening a session, with the same
  composer and the same chrome — because it *is* a session underneath, one that
  never ships and never closes.
- **The mascot is the bot's face, and it carries state.** One eye, a home shape
  and a colorway make each bot recognisable at a glance; it works while its
  session works and sleeps when the bot is disabled. While you wait for a
  reply, the creature itself is the wait indicator rather than three anonymous
  dots. The avatar is the shape alone — no card behind it.
- **A session driven by a bot says so wherever you meet it**, and opening one
  from the session list now shows the bot's face and name in the header, with
  its settings a click away.
- **Bot sessions survive idle cleanup.** They are exempt from idle archiving and
  from the live-agent cap, so a bot you have not spoken to in a week is still
  there when you come back.
- **Fixed: the first message to a new bot was swallowed.** The greeting rode in
  the same turn as the launch envelope, so it went unanswered and only your
  second message worked.

## August 16, 2026 - App sessions get the correct owner (v0.1.383)

- **A root session started from the account-scoped app is now assigned to the
  account that paired the box.** The server uses the email claim already stored
  in the box credential, but only when that email is an existing roster member.
  Explicit session owners and inherited parent owners still take priority.
- **Missing, corrupt, expired, or unknown credentials fail safely.** They leave
  the session unassigned, and the existing web fallback keeps it visible.

## August 16, 2026 - Sessions started from the app stay visible on the web (v0.1.382)

- **Filtering the live view by a person no longer hides sessions that have no
  owner.** A session started from the mobile app is created without one, so a
  browser set to your own name silently dropped it: the agent was running and
  visible on your phone, absent on the web, with nothing on screen saying it
  had been filtered out. Picking a person now shows their sessions plus every
  unclaimed one. The "Unassigned" option still isolates them, and "Everyone" is
  unchanged.

## August 15, 2026 - One session, one row (v0.1.381)

- **A delegated Codex session no longer appears twice in the session list.**
  The per-turn engine process the harness spawns internally was being listed
  as a session of its own, so one conversation showed up as two rows that both
  opened the same transcript.
- **Delegated sessions are titled by the actual ask.** They were showing
  "=== LFG SUBAGENT OPERATING CONTRACT === - You are an LFG-managed subage…"
  because a subagent prompt carries two nested envelopes and only the outer one
  was being stripped for display.

## August 15, 2026 - Connect OpenCode Go without a terminal (v0.1.380)

- **OpenCode's Go plan and Zen now connect with an API key in Settings →
  Coding agents.** Paste the key on the provider row and it is stored with
  OpenCode's own credentials. Previously the only way in was running
  `opencode auth login` in a terminal, which a hosted Computer may not have.
- **The OpenCode row now shows which providers are connected**, including ones
  signed in earlier from the CLI, instead of only reporting that OpenCode is
  signed in somewhere.
- **Connecting or disconnecting one provider leaves the others untouched**, so
  adding a Go key no longer risks the ChatGPT login `opencode auth login`
  wrote.

## August 15, 2026 - Plans run the agents they advertise (v0.1.378)

- **Starter and Starter Plus Computers now run three agents at once**, as their
  plan says. They were admitting one.
- **Free and trial Computers also run three**, matching the pricing page. The
  second session used to fail with "1 of 1 agents live".
- **Plan limits now come from the control plane instead of a table baked into
  this bundle.** A plan launched after a release used to be unknown to that
  table and fell back to a single agent, silently. New plans no longer need an
  LFG release to work.

## August 15, 2026 - Durable coding-agent runtimes (v0.1.377)

- **New coding-agent sessions no longer need terminal panes.** Claude, Codex,
  Grok, Cursor, Jcode, Copilot, OpenCode, and Pi now use their SDK, ACP, or RPC
  runtime through one shared interface. Existing terminal-pane sessions remain
  visible and controllable during the migration.
- **Queued messages now survive navigation and server restarts.** The server
  stores each send in SQLite immediately, restores its UI state, preserves
  order, and keeps failed sends available for retry.
- **Agent launch and archive are faster.** The new runtimes avoid terminal
  startup and remove the old archive grace delay. Recovery keeps the native
  provider session and the selected model.
- **Hermes is removed.** Stored Hermes schedules are disabled safely, and new
  Hermes sessions cannot start.
- **Long Claude sessions recover from silent network stalls.** The SDK runtime
  restarts its stream without replaying the accepted prompt.

## August 15, 2026 - Cursor joins the usage page (v0.1.376)

- **The Settings → Usage page now includes Cursor.** It reads included spend
  and the on-demand spending cap from the Cursor dashboard with the CLI's
  sign-in, and shows each as its own ring next to Claude, Codex, Grok, and
  OpenCode. An expired token asks you to run `cursor-agent login` instead of
  showing a raw HTTP status.

## August 14, 2026 - Jcode mark matches upstream gray (v0.1.375)

- **Jcode's agent icon no longer wears an invented blue tint.** The torus
  geometry was already correct, but the dots still used a cyan/blue gradient.
  Upstream brands the mark monochrome gray (`#7e7e7e` on the favicon). The
  icon now matches that palette, cache-busting refreshes warm browsers, and a
  regression test blocks the blue colors from coming back.

## August 14, 2026 - Jcode transcript and resume reliability (v0.1.374)

- **Jcode sessions no longer show an empty or nearly empty transcript after a
  long turn.** Jcode keeps the full chat in `session_*.json` and sometimes
  rewrites `*.journal.jsonl` down to a few recent lines. omg.dev only tailed the
  journal, so opening those sessions looked like the transcript had failed to
  load. The serve path now merges the session snapshot with the live journal and
  serves the combined history through the session index.
- **Jcode sessions survive a box reboot.** Resume now relaunches the pane against
  the remembered jcode journal id instead of falling through to the Claude path.
- **A missing transcript file no longer kills the whole server.** The live
  tailer treats a vanished file as empty instead of crashing serve.

## August 14, 2026 - Combined Claude usage and the real Jcode mark (v0.1.373)

- **Claude Auto now shows one combined usage ring.** The new-session composer
  folds every connected Claude profile into one capacity view, while a pinned
  profile still shows only its own limits.
- **Usage no longer disappears while it loads.** Mobile and desktop composers
  show animated activity rings until the selected profile data is ready.
- **Jcode now uses its real dot-matrix torus mark.** The agent picker no longer
  shows an invented letterform, and cache-busting replaces the old icon in warm
  browsers.

## August 14, 2026 - Bottom sheets get out of the keyboard's way (v0.1.372)

- **Every bottom sheet now expands into a full-height page when you focus a
  field.** The drawer-to-page morph was wired by hand on a few sheets, so the
  rest were still being shoved off the top of the screen by the mobile
  keyboard. It now lives in the shared drawer component: on by default for
  every sheet, folding back down when you leave the field, and keeping the
  sheet open while there is typed work in it.

## August 14, 2026 - Every Jcode view shows its real working state (v0.1.371)

- **Expanded Jcode sessions no longer flip back to Idle while working.** The
  session list had the corrected status, but its one-second live stream still
  used the old generic terminal detector and overrode the card with Idle. The
  WebSocket, fallback stream, and fleet watcher now all use Jcode-aware activity
  detection.

## August 14, 2026 - Jcode stays visibly active during long turns (v0.1.370)

- **Long Jcode turns no longer look stuck.** Once enough output scrolled the
  startup header off the terminal, the status detector stopped recognizing the
  pane as Jcode and reported it as idle. Managed Jcode sessions now use their
  known agent type and keep following the live `→` turn indicator.

## August 14, 2026 - Jcode sessions report the right state and controls (v0.1.369)

- **Jcode no longer looks busy while it waits for you.** Draft text, dialogs,
  and other idle terminal content no longer trigger the Working state. Active
  turns now follow Jcode's live turn indicator.
- **The omg.dev instruction contract is visible again.** Live prompts include a
  transport timestamp, and the chat now recognizes that form and restores the
  collapsible instruction box above the user's task.
- **Jcode has its full thinking control.** New sessions can use `low`, `medium`,
  `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`, and the selected effort is applied when the session
  starts.
- **The mobile update drawer keeps its action visible.** Long release notes now
  scroll inside a drawer that fits its content and the screen, so the Update
  button does not fall below the viewport.

## August 14, 2026 - The server tells you the truth about which version it is running (v0.1.368)

- **A running server could claim a version it was not running.** It read the
  version off disk every time you asked, so once an update landed in the folder
  it reported the new number immediately, even though the old code was still
  serving until a restart. Two fixes looked deployed earlier this week when
  neither was.
- **It now answers with the version it actually started on**, and reports a
  boot id alongside it. The id changes only when the server truly restarts, so
  "did my update take effect" has a straight answer instead of a number that
  can be right about the folder and wrong about the process.

## August 14, 2026 - Hosted Computers start with credential-free OpenCode (v0.1.367)

- **A new hosted Computer now opens with OpenCode selected.** The host can set
  the first coding agent before the composer starts, so a first prompt cannot
  fall through to the managed Claude path.
- **Your saved agent still wins.** The new host default applies only when this
  browser has no valid saved selection.

## August 13, 2026 - Hosted owner filter no longer hides every session (v0.1.366)

Hosted Computers create unassigned sessions with an empty roster. A leftover
owner filter hid them all while Settings still showed live agents — and
"All projects" could not fix it because that is a different filter. Hosted
surfaces now open Everyone, empty rosters clear invalid owner filters, and
an explicit Everyone selection stays sticky.

## August 13, 2026 - Scheduled runs stop filling your session slots (v0.1.365)

- **A leftover scheduled run no longer takes a New session slot.** On a
  Computer, those fires sit in their own pool. Wake recovery does not relaunch
  them, and they stay off the live rail. Self-hosted LFG is unchanged.
- **The session list is smaller on every poll.** The spawn command line — which
  carried the full prompt — is no longer sent unless something asks for it.
- **Signing-in checks no longer freeze the box.** Auth probes for jcode and
  Codex now run off the event loop, so other requests keep answering while
  those CLIs start.
- **Updates have a What's new drawer.** It shows the notes since your installed
  version, and you can update, skip, or retry from there.

## August 13, 2026 - Jcode chats show up in the transcript (v0.1.364)

- **Opening a jcode session showed an empty chat.** The agent was working in
  tmux and writing a journal under `~/.jcode/sessions`, but LFG never looked
  there, so `/messages` returned 404 and the live view stayed blank.
- **LFG now finds that journal and reads it.** User text, assistant replies,
  thinking, and tool calls come through the same transcript path as Cursor and
  Grok. Existing jcode sessions pick this up after the restart — you do not
  have to start a new one.

## August 13, 2026 - Opening the skill picker stops downloading a small library (v0.1.363)

- **Typing `/` in the composer was pulling 419 KB.** Almost all of it — 354 KB
  — was the first 4000 characters of every skill's documentation, for all 116
  skills, sent so the browser could search inside them. You were downloading
  the manuals to search the manuals.
- **The box searches its own skills now.** It already keeps that text in
  memory, so the picker asks it a question instead of asking for the library.
  The response is 59 KB, and a search comes back in about 8ms.
- **Nothing about what you can find has changed.** Searching still matches
  inside a skill's body, not just its name — looking up "agent-browser" still
  surfaces the skills that merely mention it. Names still filter instantly as
  you type, with the deeper matches filling in underneath.

## August 13, 2026 - The slow first open is gone too (v0.1.362)

- **Finishes what v0.1.361 started.** That release cached the coding-agent
  check, which fixed opening the dashboard twice in a row but not the case
  that actually annoys you: come back after a quiet minute and the cache had
  expired, so you paid the full second and a half again. Measured after
  v0.1.361: 33ms when warm, still 1582ms when not.
- **The dashboard now answers from the last known state and re-checks in the
  background**, and it does the first check when the server starts rather than
  when you first open a page. So the wait is not shortened, it is off your
  path entirely. Logging in or out of an agent still clears it immediately, so
  what you see stays true.

## August 13, 2026 - The dashboard stops asking your CLIs if they are logged in on every load (v0.1.361)

- **Opening the dashboard was costing a second and a half of pure waiting.**
  Every page load asked each coding agent whether it was signed in, and it
  asked by actually running them: `cursor-agent status` starts a whole Node
  runtime, `jcode auth status` runs a shell wrapper. That is 26 processes
  spawned per load, measured at 1542ms, to re-answer a question that only
  changes when you log in or out of something.
- **It was also holding up everything else on the box.** That probe ran
  synchronously, so while it worked, nothing else the server was doing could
  make progress. It is why small requests landed at two seconds during a cold
  open: a config endpoint that does 1ms of work was measured at 1918ms, and
  the same endpoint took 307ms when nothing else was competing with it.
- **The answer is cached for a minute now, and dropped the moment it can
  change.** Connecting an account, running setup, adding a key or logging in
  through the terminal all clear it, so what you see is still current. Hitting
  Refresh in Settings still forces the full check.

## August 13, 2026 - The keyboard stops pushing sheets off the screen (v0.1.360)

- **The project picker and the Resume sheet now grow into a page when you tap a
  field.** Naming a new project folder, or searching your prompts and sessions,
  used to leave the field pinned under the phone keyboard: the sheet is sized to
  its contents, and iOS simply shoves that off the top of the screen. Both
  sheets now do what the auto agent forms already did and become a full-height
  page, so the field stays visible and the list keeps the space above it.
- **Nothing you have typed disappears when the keyboard goes away.** Folding
  back down waits, ignores a tap heading for the sheet's own buttons, and stays
  open while any field still holds text.

## August 13, 2026 - Settings cannot take the app down on a bad update check (v0.1.359)

- **Opening Settings no longer crashes if the update payload is empty.** The
  last fix refused to store a bad `/api/install` answer, but the row still
  read `info?.install.channel`. That only guards `info`. A missing `install`
  still threw, and the router boundary replaced the whole app. The read now
  chains through `install` as well, and a throw in that row stays in that row.

## August 13, 2026 - Settings stops crashing when an update check comes back empty (v0.1.358)

- **Opening Settings no longer takes the app down.** The update check assumed the
  server always answers with the install details. When something else came back
  with a 200 instead — a stale service worker serving the app shell, or a proxy
  returning an empty body — the page crashed while drawing the LFG updates row.
  It was showing up on iPhones. The check now treats an unrecognisable answer the
  same as a failed one and shows the existing error line instead.

## August 13, 2026 - Auto agents stop slowing the app down (v0.1.357)

- **The agent list carries a fraction of what it used to.** Every refresh sent
  every auto agent's entire prompt, even though the list only ever shows the
  first line of one. On a box with 29 agents that was 99 KB, every five seconds.
  It is now under 4 KB. The saving is biggest on a hosted Computer, where that
  traffic crosses the network twice on its way to you.
- **Editing an agent still gives you the whole prompt.** The editor loads the
  full text when it opens and Save waits until it has arrived, so a long prompt
  can never be overwritten by its own opening line.
- **Nothing refreshes while you are looking at something else.** A background
  tab or a locked phone used to keep polling for sessions and agents every five
  seconds. It now stops, and catches up the moment you come back.
- **Less data between your machine and a hosted Computer.** Responses were being
  uncompressed before they were sent, then travelled that way. The connection
  compresses them itself now.

## August 13, 2026 - Grok 4.6, and Cursor's Grok models come back (v0.1.356)

- **Grok 4.6 is selectable on both the Grok and Cursor agents.** It is the
  default for new Grok sessions on boxes whose CLI has it. Boxes on an older
  grok now fall back to a model they actually have, instead of a pinned id that
  may not exist there.
- **Cursor's Grok models are in the picker again.** Cursor renamed them to
  `cursor-grok-*`, and the model list silently discarded every one of them. The
  picker offered no Grok at all even while Cursor was reporting fourteen builds.
- **Asking for "max" thinking no longer gives you the weakest setting.** On a
  model family that stops at xhigh, an explicit max request quietly resolved to
  the lowest effort available.

## August 13, 2026 - Schedules fire on time on cloud Computers (v0.1.355)

- **A schedule on a managed cloud Computer now wakes it.** Schedules only tick
  while the machine is awake, so "every morning at 8" on a Computer that had
  gone to sleep used to fire late, whenever you next opened it. LFG now tells
  the platform the times it needs, and the platform wakes the machine at the
  due minute. Schedules on your own machines are unchanged.
- **Nothing about a schedule leaves the machine except the clock.** The
  platform receives opaque ids, cron times, and your timezone. Names, prompts,
  and folders stay on the Computer.

## August 12, 2026 - A cleaner new-session prompt (v0.1.354)

- **The new-session prompt stays on one line on a phone.** Its shorter
  "What should we work on?" wording keeps the empty composer compact and makes
  the invitation easier to scan.

## August 12, 2026 - Cursor stops asking you to connect it (v0.1.353)

- **A signed-in Cursor is treated as signed in.** The agent picker kept showing
  Cursor greyed out with a "connect" badge on boxes that had already run
  `cursor-agent login`, and tapping it sent you to a settings page with nothing
  left to do. Cursor now reads its saved sign-in and shows up as a launchable
  agent.
- **Same fix for Copilot.** An interactive `/login` now counts as your
  connected account, so Copilot appears in the picker instead of being filtered
  out of it. A platform-supplied `GH_TOKEN` still makes it runnable without
  being claimed as your account.

## August 12, 2026 - Your project list is yours (v0.1.352)

- **You can remove a project.** The list was built by scanning your projects
  folder, so every git checkout in it showed up whether you wanted it there or
  not — and "remove" only ever worked on paths you had pinned by hand. On
  anything else it quietly did nothing and still said it worked. Removing a
  project now sticks.
- **Manage mode in the Projects sheet.** Tap Manage and every row gets two
  actions: remove it from the list, which leaves your files exactly where they
  are, or delete the folder from disk, which shows you what is inside and asks
  you to confirm first. Deleting a folder was previously buried in the folder
  browser. Removal sits behind the toggle so a delete button is never under the
  tap you use to pick a project all day.
- **Adding a folder back works.** Re-adding a project you removed brings it
  back instead of writing a setting and changing nothing on screen. Deleting a
  folder also forgets it, so creating a new project at the same path later is
  not silently suppressed.
- **A folder you picked by hand no longer loses to one you forgot about.** Two
  projects whose folders share a name kept only one row, and the scanned one
  always won — so pinning `~/work/duet` while an old `~/repos/duet` existed
  wrote the setting and never showed the project. The one you chose wins now.
- **Shipped posts cannot invent a project.** The project label on a Shipped
  post is checked against your real projects; an agent that passes something
  else gets the label of the project it was actually working in, or no label at
  all, instead of one that just looks like provenance.

## August 12, 2026 - The product calls itself omg.dev (v0.1.351)

- **One name, everywhere you read it.** The app said "OMG" in some places and
  "omg.dev" in others, sometimes on the same screen — the header showed one
  spelling on a hosted Computer and another on your own box. It is omg.dev now:
  update toasts, storage and diagnostics copy, the transcript menus, and the
  banner about an older capability contract.
- **The instructions block in a transcript is labelled "omg.dev
  instructions".** Every managed agent opens with that contract, so it is the
  most-read copy the product has. It now introduces itself by the company name,
  and so does the tool catalog every agent loads: "List omg.dev Sessions",
  "Create omg.dev Sub-Agent", and the rest.
- **Older sessions keep their real titles.** The envelope header changed with
  the name, and everything that reads it still accepts both earlier spellings.
  A session started before this release keeps showing what you asked for
  instead of falling back to raw contract boilerplate.
- **Long-lived sessions will offer to reload.** The capability version moved, so
  a session that has been open since before the rename shows the usual "close
  and resume" banner and picks up the renamed catalog.

## August 12, 2026 - Device settings belong to whoever you opened the app in (v0.1.350)

- **The More page no longer appears when the Computer is opened inside
  omg.** Everything on it describes the device in your hand — notifications,
  appearance, sound, haptics, install — and omg already has its own settings
  for all of those. Showing ours too put two switches next to each other for
  one thing, and ours were the pair that could not work: notifications there
  had no way to reach your device except by borrowing something that belongs
  to omg, which is what was reloading the whole app. Turn notifications on in
  omg's own settings instead. Nothing changes when you open your Computer at
  its own address, where the page is still yours and still works.

## August 12, 2026 - Settings stops lying about what it saved (v0.1.349)

- **"Archive idle agents after" now actually saves.** Picking a window told you
  it worked, then quietly snapped back to "Off", and nothing was ever archived.
  The save endpoint accepted settings from a fixed list and this one was not on
  it, so the value was dropped on the way in — and the reply still came back
  200, carrying the old value, which is what reset the dropdown. The sweep
  itself was never broken. It just never had a window to work with. An
  out-of-range value is now refused outright instead of being quietly rounded
  to a different number than the one you picked.
- **Opening Settings → More no longer reloads the whole app.** Only in the
  hosted UI, and only on that page, because it is the one page with the push
  notification toggle. Working out whether it was running inside another
  product, the toggle looked at the page's address — which belongs to the host,
  not to us — decided it was running standalone, and installed the host's own
  background worker. That worker's job is to clear caches by reloading every
  open tab, and it removes itself afterwards, so the next visit to More did it
  all over again.
- **The notification toggle explains itself instead of vanishing.** Where push
  is unavailable — an iPhone that has not added omg to the Home Screen, or a
  hosted UI that has not been given somewhere to put notifications — the row
  used to render its label with nothing beside it, which reads as a broken
  screen rather than an unavailable feature. It now shows the switch, greyed
  out, with the reason next to it.

## August 12, 2026 - The composer stops defaulting to a folder that is gone (v0.1.348)

- **A new session no longer starts in a project that no longer exists.** The
  composer remembered your last project and trusted it forever, without ever
  checking it against the projects you actually have. Delete that project — or
  open the Computer on a second device, since the memory is per-device — and
  the composer stayed pinned to a folder the machine could not find. It now
  keeps your last choice only while it is still a real project, and otherwise
  falls back to the first one.
- **The project button shows a project again, not a path.** With nothing to
  match, the button had been printing the raw directory instead of a name, so
  it read as a truncated "/home/dev/re…". That was always the symptom of the
  bug above, and it disappears with it.
- **Landing a change stops failing at random.** `scripts/land-session.sh` shut
  down roughly half the time on a machine with many worktrees, and did it
  before printing its first line: no error, no partial landing, and main
  silently never moved. The main-worktree lookup was closing a pipe early and
  taking the whole script down with it.

## August 12, 2026 - App sessions stop seeing LFG release plumbing (v0.1.347)

- **Application sessions no longer receive instructions to run
  `scripts/land-session.sh`.** That command belongs only to changes in LFG's
  own source repository. The global wording became especially confusing after
  "LFG source" was renamed to "OMG source," which made ordinary app work look
  like it needed the local LFG release workflow.
- **The LFG shipping gate remains the single owner of landing.** It detects an
  LFG source worktree and returns the exact recovery command only when that
  session tries to ship an uncommitted, unmerged, or undeployed change. Other
  repositories never see the command or inherit LFG's deployment policy.

## August 12, 2026 - The agent limit is yours to overrule (v0.1.346)

- **Hitting the live-agent limit no longer pins a red banner above every
  screen.** That banner had no dismiss and no expiry, and it was only ever
  cleared for one specific unrelated message — so a wall you had already worked
  around stayed there until you reloaded the tab, pushing the whole mobile
  layout down with it. It is now a toast, and the banner is reserved for what
  its name always implied: the app failing to load at all.
- **A self-hosted machine stops being told to upgrade its Computer.** The limit
  on your own box is a number you chose in Settings, not a plan you bought, so
  the refusal now says so: "22 of 22 agents live — close an agent, or raise the
  limit in Settings". Hosted Computers, where the limit really is the plan, are
  unchanged.
- **"Start anyway" starts it anyway.** The cap on your own hardware is soft
  now. The toast offers to overrule it and repeats the request for you — no
  retyping the prompt, no trip to Settings first — from a new session, a resume,
  or a reply to a finding. Edit the prompt while the offer waits and it sends
  what you can see, not what you had typed when the wall appeared.
- **The override cannot take the machine down with it.** It waives the agent
  count and only the count: a self-hosted box normally skips the memory check,
  so overruling the cap switches it on, and every launch now books its share of
  memory so several starting at once cannot each be told the same memory is
  free. Where that reading cannot be trusted — macOS reports free memory in a
  way that ignores reclaimable cache — your decision wins rather than being
  refused on a number that means something else.

## August 12, 2026 - The first-run intro stops reappearing on older Computers (v0.1.345)

- **Dismissing the new first-run intro now sticks on a Computer that hasn't
  updated yet.** Computers update on your command rather than automatically, so
  a box running an older release could not record that the intro was seen — and
  it came back on every load until a coding agent was connected. It is now also
  remembered on the device, which is only consulted when the Computer itself
  cannot answer.

## August 12, 2026 - First-run onboarding returns to hosted Computers (v0.1.344)

- **New hosted Computers walk through setup again.** The embedded connect gate
  was switched off in August on the grounds that the host would own Computer
  onboarding, and the replacement was never built — so for four months nobody
  arriving on a hosted Computer was ever offered Claude Code or Codex. It is
  back, as three optional screens: connect a coding agent, connect GitHub, and
  a closing screen covering the two things worth knowing (bring your own agent,
  and put work on a schedule).
- **"Skip for now" finally means it.** The gate's dismissal lived only in
  browser memory, so it reappeared on every reload until an agent was
  connected — a permanent wall for anyone happy on the free credential-free
  agent. It is now remembered per Computer, and Settings → Setup guide replays
  it whenever you want.
- **The GitHub step is skipped when it cannot work.** That row has no installer
  of its own, so on a Computer without the GitHub CLI it used to render as a
  permanently disabled dead end mid-flow.
- **Self-hosted onboarding is untouched.** The open-source flow (profile,
  agents, repo, first session) is deliberately separate, and neither flow can
  complete or reset the other.

## August 11, 2026 - A queued message looks queued (v0.1.343)

- **A message you queue behind a running turn now says so, and stays at the
  bottom until the agent reads it.** Holding send to queue produced a bubble
  identical to one the agent had already received, dropped in at the moment you
  wrote it — and the turn it was waiting on kept streaming thinking, tools and
  replies underneath it. Your message scrolled up into the middle of an answer
  it had no part in, and the only hint it was queued was a toast that vanished
  seconds later. Queued messages now render as a dashed, muted "waiting" bubble
  labelled *Queued · sends when this turn ends*, pinned below the working
  indicator: what the agent is doing now, then what it will read next. When the
  agent finally picks it up, the bubble becomes an ordinary sent message in its
  proper place.

## August 11, 2026 - Locked agents wait for the roster (v0.1.342)

- **The greyed-out agent icons no longer flash on every load.** An empty
  coding-agent list is what the app shows before its roster arrives, and the
  new picker was reading that as "nothing is connected" — so all five popular
  agents appeared locked for a moment on every load, and a signed-out demo
  surface showed five agents it had no way to connect at all. The picker now
  waits for the roster before advertising anything.

## August 11, 2026 - Every popular agent is on the picker, and plan walls become offers (v0.1.341)

- **Claude, Codex and the other popular agents now appear even before you
  connect them.** The agent picker only ever showed what the machine could
  actually launch, which on a fresh hosted Computer is a single icon. Anyone
  holding a Claude Code or Codex subscription had no way to learn from that
  screen that omg.dev takes it. The five agents at the head of the roster now
  stay on the strip either way — greyed out, with a plus, when there is no
  account behind them — and tapping one opens Coding agents so you can connect
  it. Nothing else changed about launching: a greyed agent is never selected,
  never cycled to, and never submitted.
- **A hosted surface can turn "your plan allows N agents" into an upgrade
  prompt instead of an error.** Being told the plan is full is not a fault, but
  it arrived as red text beside the composer and was easy to miss at exactly the
  moment someone was ready to pay. The machine now tags that refusal so an
  embedding host can raise its own plan picker; a self-hosted box hitting its
  own max-live-agents setting is deliberately not tagged, because that is a
  preference you can edit, not a plan.
- **For hosts:** two optional `OmgAppSurface` props, `onOpenSettingsPage` and
  `onPlanLimit`. Failed requests from `@omg-dev/client` now carry their HTTP
  status and any server-supplied `code` instead of flattening to a bare
  message. Both additions are backwards compatible.

## August 11, 2026 - Jcode joins the roster and artifact cards return (v0.1.340)

- **Jcode can now run as a managed omg.dev session.** Install or connect Jcode
  from Coding agents, select its discovered models, and start a persistent
  session from the same composer as Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and other agents.
- **Jcode follow-ups stay in one conversation.** omg.dev drives Jcode's simple
  REPL through its serialized tmux transport, preserves multi-line prompts as
  one turn, and waits for the next prompt before showing the session as idle.
- **The shared OMG tools are available inside Jcode.** Setup registers the local
  MCP server in Jcode's configuration while preserving existing MCP entries.
- **New image, video, and HTML artifacts render as cards again.** The artifact
  matcher now recognizes the renamed `omg_*` tools while keeping old `lfg_*`
  transcripts compatible.

## August 11, 2026 - Findings get their own name, and the push toggle heals itself (v0.1.339)

- **A session started from a watch-agent finding is named after the finding.**
  Replying to a finding seeds the session with a prompt that opens "An
  automated watch agent ("Fleet Health") flagged this:" — useful context for the
  agent, but it was also the only thing the session header had to show. Titles
  truncate to one line, so that identical preamble ate all of it and every
  graduated finding looked like every other one, with the actual finding cut
  off. The header now leads with the finding; the context stays in the prompt.
- **Turning notifications on recovers instead of dead-ending.** "No service
  worker is available on this page, so notifications can't be delivered here"
  could stick until you reloaded the page — the toggle waited for a service
  worker registration but never made one, so an offline cold start, an evicted
  worker or a mid-deploy hiccup left it permanently stuck. It now registers the
  worker itself and waits for it to activate.
- **Turning notifications off actually unsubscribes on an embedded surface.**
  Off reported success while the device stayed subscribed and kept receiving
  pushes, because the toggle reached for the host page's service worker rather
  than OMG's own. On a host page with no controlling worker it hung outright.

## August 11, 2026 - Terminal links are tappable again (v0.1.338)

- **Tapping a detected link in the terminal opens the link.** The invisible
  swipe-up handle for the keys pad sat on top of the link tray and covered the
  bottom half of every URL chip, so tapping a login URL a CLI printed — an
  OAuth "open this to authorize" link, most often — popped open the keys pad
  instead of the browser.
- **The handle now only overlays the terminal itself**, so the link chips, their
  copy buttons and the tray's dismiss button all keep their full tap targets.

## August 10, 2026 - Delete a project folder from the picker (v0.1.337)

- **You can delete a folder from the project browser.** Browse could create
  projects but never remove one, so abandoned "New Project" shells piled up in
  the repos root with no way out of the UI. Every row now has a delete button.
- **Empty folders are badged "Empty".** They're not git repos, so they never
  showed up in the projects list to be noticed in the first place — which is
  how you end up with a pile of them and no idea where they came from.
- **The warning is saved for folders that have something to lose.** An empty
  folder, or a starter project that never got past its README, deletes with one
  confirmation. Anything with real files lists exactly what's inside — plus
  uncommitted changes and unpushed history — before it will delete anything.
- **Safety rails.** Your home folder, the projects root, the worktree folder and
  OMG's own install can't be deleted, nor can anything containing them, and a
  folder with a session still running in it is refused until you close it.

## August 10, 2026 - Files moves into the ⋮ menu (v0.1.336)

- **Files opens from the session ⋮ menu.** Making it its own header button just
  moved the clutter: the header carried two icon buttons while every other
  per-session action — Terminal, Token usage, Rename, Fork — already lived
  behind one menu. Files now sits in that menu, next to Terminal, and the panel
  stays open after the menu closes.
- **The "3/7" session counter is gone from the chat header.** You switch
  sessions by swiping the input bar or with the arrow keys, not by that number,
  and dropping it gives long session titles the width it was taking.

## August 10, 2026 - The update button explains itself (v0.1.335)

- **A greyed-out "Update & restart" now says why.** Boxes with nothing
  supervising OMG — a hosted sandbox started straight from a control-plane
  command, most often — can't restart themselves after updating, so the button
  greyed out under a tooltip you can't even hover on a phone. The reason now
  takes over the line under "LFG updates", wraps instead of being clipped, and
  names the terminal command that updates the box anyway.
- **Bottom sheets that are nothing but fields become full pages when you type.**
  The auto-agent create and edit forms used to stay content-sized cards that the
  keyboard shoved off the top; they now expand the way the finding sheet always
  has, with the body scrolling under a pinned footer. A sheet holding text you
  typed stays open rather than folding away when the keyboard is dismissed.

## August 10, 2026 - Files moves into the session header (v0.1.334)

- **Files is a normal header button now.** It used to be a pill floating over
  the bottom of every open transcript — covering the last message, and holding
  a strip of empty space under the conversation even for sessions with nothing
  to review. It now sits in the session header next to the ⋮ menu, on the
  desktop card and in the phone sheet, where the rest of the per-session
  controls live. The bottom of the chat is back to showing the "files changed /
  Review" bar only when there is actually something to review.
- **OpenCode's model picker follows OpenCode's own sign-in.** Signing in to
  Claude used to unlock the whole OpenCode catalog, so a box whose OpenCode had
  never been signed in offered models that failed the instant they launched and
  hid the free OpenCode Zen models it could actually run.

## August 10, 2026 - One Claude ring for the whole fleet (v0.1.333)

- **Your Claude accounts share a single usage ring.** Two logins used to sit
  on the usage arc as two separate rings against two independent quotas, so
  "how much Claude have I got left" was arithmetic you had to do yourself.
  They now merge into one node showing the share of your combined capacity
  that's spent — two accounts at 50% reads as 50%, not 100%. Hover or tap it
  and the total splits back into the accounts behind it, for the same window
  the ring is drawing, so the numbers visibly add up.
- **Fewer, larger nodes on the arc.** Node size steps down once there are more
  than six of them, and a second Claude account was usually what pushed a box
  over that line.
- An account that can't be read is left out of the total rather than counted
  as free headroom, and says so ("1 of 2 accounts reporting") instead of
  quietly reporting a rosier number than you have.

## August 10, 2026 - Findings from worktree agents can start a session (v0.1.332)

- **Storage & performance can now show you which session is eating the
  machine.** Expand "Details" for a per-session breakdown: total memory split
  by what is actually holding it — the coding agent, its backend, its MCP
  servers, any dev server it started, its browser — plus the size of the
  session's worktree, sorted heaviest first. A session is not one process; on a
  busy box a single one spans 300 MB to 2 GB, and until now the only way to see
  that was to SSH in and read `ps`.
- **Dev servers left behind by closed sessions are now called out.** Closing a
  session stops its agent, its tmux session and its browser, but not the `expo`
  or `vite` server the agent started — those keep running and holding memory.
  Any that outlive their session are grouped under a "reclaimable" heading with
  how long they have been running, so they can be found and stopped. On the
  machine this was built for, that was 1.9 GB held for nearly three days.
- **Changed: your agent limit now counts idle agents, not just working ones.**
  An idle agent has stopped using CPU but has not given back its memory, so the
  limit was measuring the one thing that does not correlate with running out of
  RAM. You may reach your limit sooner than before; the capacity readout now
  shows live agents against the cap to match.
- **New: agents can be archived automatically after sitting idle.** Off by
  default — pick a window under Agent capacity. Archiving keeps the transcript
  and the resume record, so an archived session reopens where it left off, and
  an agent in the middle of a turn is never touched.

- **Fixed: "Execute" on a finding failed with "unknown repo".** If the auto
  agent that reported the finding runs in a git worktree rather than the main
  checkout, acting on its findings was impossible — the button always errored.
  The repo picker deliberately lists one entry per project, so a worktree like
  `repos/vibes-e2e` never appears in it, and the session launcher only
  recognised paths that were literally inside a listed repo. It now maps a
  worktree back to the checkout that owns it, exactly as the rest of the app
  already does when it groups those agents under their project. Findings from
  worktree-based agents have been unactionable since those agents were added.
- **A repo you pinned and later deleted no longer lingers in your settings.**

## August 10, 2026 - Every agent picker shows the same agents (v0.1.331)

- **Fixed: the finding sheet offered a shorter agent list than the composer.**
  Open a finding and the agent strip showed a handful of icons; the composer
  right next to it showed the full roster plus a chip for each connected
  Claude account. The auto-agent sheets were reading their own separate copy
  of the agent list, so anything added to the real one never reached them.
  There is now a single list behind every picker in the app.
- **Graduating a finding can use any agent, and any Claude account.** "Make
  the change" starts an ordinary session, so it was never limited to the
  agents a scheduled watch agent can run — it just looked that way. The full
  roster is available there now, account chips included.
- **Scheduled auto agents can pin a Claude account.** Pick which account a
  watch agent bills to instead of leaving it to whichever one is active,
  clear it back to Auto at any time, and it's dropped automatically if you
  move the agent to a backend that has no accounts. An account that later
  gets disconnected doesn't silence the agent — the run falls back to the
  default account and says so in its log, and findings from that agent stay
  launchable instead of failing.

## August 10, 2026 - Attached images keep their shape (v0.1.330)

- **Fixed: sending several images at once distorted them.** Attach two
  screenshots to one message and the wider one was stretched to match the
  taller one's height, so a wide UI capture came out squashed and hard to
  read. The row of attachments was laid out to make every tile the same
  height, which quietly overrode each image's own proportions. Each
  attachment now keeps its natural shape and the tiles line up along their
  tops. A single attachment was never affected, which is why this only
  showed up when a turn carried more than one.
- **The finding sheet turns into a page when you type in it.** The composer
  now sits behind a button instead of opening by default, and the sheet no
  longer grabs focus on mount — so tapping a finding to read it stops
  throwing the keyboard over the thing you tapped. When a field does take
  focus, the sheet claims the band above the keyboard and its body scrolls,
  keeping the finding visible while you write.

## August 10, 2026 - Codex sessions start again (v0.1.329)

- **Fixed: every Codex turn failed with "invalid transport".** Codex sessions
  died before the model ran, reporting `Error loading config.toml: invalid
  transport in mcp_servers.lfg`. Nothing was wrong with your config — the
  launcher was adding a setting for an MCP server named `lfg`, a name that
  stopped existing when the server was renamed to `omg`. Codex treats a server
  with no way to reach it as a broken config file and refuses to start at all,
  so a stale name took down the whole session rather than just its tools. The
  launcher now reads the name out of your Codex config instead of assuming
  one, and adds nothing when it finds no server of ours — so a renamed,
  relocated, or absent entry can no longer stop a session from starting.

## August 10, 2026 - A calmer finding sheet, and feedback that retunes the agent (v0.1.328)

- **Tell an auto agent what it got wrong, from the finding itself.** The new
  Feedback button on a finding takes a sentence — "stop flagging cosmetic
  nits", "only when it costs a tap on mobile" — and rewrites that agent's
  standing instruction in place, grounded in the finding you were looking at
  and in the agent's own repo. The correction is live before the next
  scheduled run, instead of meaning a trip into the editor to hand-edit a
  prompt you didn't write. It makes the smallest edit that satisfies the
  feedback: "stop flagging this" tightens the bar, it never blacklists the one
  finding or drops what the agent watches.
- **The finding sheet is quieter.** The finding's title now carries the
  headline weight and the agent name drops to a metadata line, so what you
  opened the sheet to read is what you read first.
- **Launch settings fold into one line.** The agent strip, model dropdown and
  thinking pill were three always-open control rows above the composer; they
  are now a single line of text — "grok-4.5 · medium thinking" — that expands
  on tap.
- **One CTA instead of four.** Copy, Feedback and Dismiss share one quiet row,
  leaving "Make the change" as the only button that reads as a call to action.
  A long reasoning list also clamps behind "N more details" so the suggestion
  and the actions stay above the fold.

## August 9, 2026 - copilot gets its real logo (v0.1.327)

- **copilot sessions now show the actual GitHub Copilot logo.** The mark was
  a hand-drawn stand-in — an outlined shape with two bars for eyes — that
  looked like a broken or generic icon sitting next to the real brand marks
  every other agent ships. It is now the official Copilot glyph, on the same
  dark rounded tile as grok, pi, and opencode.
- Agent icons are cached for a year, so the new art comes with a version bump
  that pulls it into browsers still holding the old one.

## August 9, 2026 - Dictation works on a hosted UI, whatever machine is behind it (v0.1.325)

- **Dictation on a hosted UI now uses the host's transcription, not your
  machine's.** The microphone used to stream to whichever machine you had
  connected, and that machine picked a speech provider from its own
  environment. Drive a self-hosted machine from a hosted OMG UI and it
  transcribed on your own ElevenLabs key — or, if you had no key, the mic
  button checked the machine, found nothing, and asked you to configure one.
  A hosted surface can now hand the app its own transcription endpoint, and
  the audio goes there instead. Your machine is no longer in the audio path,
  which also removes a hop from the round trip.
- **The setup check is skipped when the host supplies transcription.** That
  check asks which key *the machine* holds, which is the wrong question once
  the host provides the service; leaving it in place aborted the recording on
  exactly the keyless machine this is meant to serve.
- **Standalone installs are unchanged.** With no host endpoint the app still
  streams to its own machine and uses the provider configured there.

## August 9, 2026 - Notifications pick the right service worker (v0.1.326)

- **A hosted surface no longer enrols your device into silence.** Notifications
  are delivered to a service worker, and a hosted page can have several — the
  dashboard has one that only clears old caches and never shows a notification.
  OMG was picking whichever one happened to serve the page, so on a hosted UI
  the toggle switched on, the machine sent successfully, and nothing ever
  appeared. The host now names the worker it dedicates to OMG, and until it
  does, the toggle says so rather than pretending to work.
- **A stale notification subscription is now replaced instead of reused.** If
  the machine's notification keys were ever regenerated, the browser kept an
  old subscription that every send was rejected against — the toggle looked on
  and nothing arrived, with nothing to explain it.

## August 9, 2026 - Notifications survive a hosted UI (v0.1.324)

- **Push notifications now carry their own text, encrypted end to end.** The
  server used to send an empty "wake up" push, and the phone fetched the actual
  notice back from the machine afterwards. That works when the app and the
  machine share an address, which is the standalone setup — but if you drive a
  self-hosted machine from a hosted OMG UI, the fetch goes to the host instead
  of to your machine, and it knows nothing about your notifications. Enabling
  the toggle appeared to work and then nothing ever arrived. The notice now
  travels inside the push itself (encrypted with your device's own keys, so
  nothing in between can read it), which removes that callback entirely.
- **Notifications say what happened, wherever they arrive.** Questions from an
  agent, new findings, repeat findings, and frontend errors previously relied on
  that fetch-back for their wording. They now carry their own title and body,
  the same way "Shipped:" and session-finished notices already did.
- **Tapping a notification opens the right app.** Deep links are sent as full
  addresses resolved against the surface you actually subscribed from, and a
  notification that can't navigate an already-open window now opens a new one
  instead of silently focusing a stale page.
- **The notification toggle no longer hangs.** On a page whose host registers no
  service worker, turning notifications on would spin forever after you granted
  permission. It now reports the real reason instead.

## August 9, 2026 - The named local URL goes, and the mobile app joins the audit (v0.1.323)

- **The named local URL (`omg.local`) is gone**, along with its Settings toggle.
  It advertised a `.local` name for this machine's loopback over mDNS while the
  server ran, on macOS only — and the caveat under the switch was most of the
  story: you still had to install the PWA from `localhost`, because browsers only
  treat localhost and loopback IPs as secure origins, so the `.local` name could
  never register a service worker. A toggle whose own help text tells you not to
  use it for the main flow was not worth its surface area. Setting an explicit
  `OMG_LOCAL_HOSTNAME` in `omg setup` is untouched and still works.
- **The mobile app is finally covered by the dependency-advisory gate.** `mobile/`
  is an Expo project on an npm lockfile and is not a workspace member, so
  `bun audit` structurally could not see it — it was filed as a known exclusion
  whose stated fix ("convert it to bun.lock") nobody was ever going to do. Two
  high-severity advisories were sitting in there, visible to Dependabot and
  invisible to our own green audit runs. The gate now audits each root with the
  tool that can read it, so both advisories are recorded, dated, and re-verified
  against the advisory API on every run.

## August 9, 2026 - pi can sign in, and the agents page stops shouting (v0.1.322)

- **You can sign in to pi from Settings.** pi shipped with no sign-in at all —
  just an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` note and two disabled buttons — because it has no
  `pi login` command to drive; its login lives inside the interactive TUI. We now
  use pi's own credential library in-process, so three providers connect from the
  same UI as every other agent: **Claude (Pro/Max)** and **ChatGPT (Codex)** by
  OAuth, and **OpenCode Zen** by API key. Credentials are written to pi's own
  `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` under pi's lock, so a token refresh happening at the
  same time cannot rotate a refresh token out from under itself.
- **pi can actually run as the provider you connected.** pi sessions could only
  ever name one provider, so ChatGPT and Zen models would have been unreachable
  even after signing in. Models now carry their provider, and only models whose
  provider is connected are offered.
- **pi no longer reports "Ready" when nothing is configured.** The check treated
  the existence of `auth.json` as proof of sign-in, but pi creates that file as
  `{}` on first launch — so every machine that had ever started pi looked
  connected. It now looks inside, and also counts env vars and pinned provider
  keys.
- **The coding-agents settings page shows the state that matters.** It used to
  print two badges, every check with its resolved binary path, an instructions
  sentence, an install command and a login command — per agent, times seven. A
  working agent now says nothing; a broken one says what is missing, and the
  diagnostics are one tap down.
- **`omg setup` stopped handing out a URL it never checked.** On macOS the
  summary's first line was `http://omg.local:8766` whenever `dns-sd` existed,
  assuming the mDNS name had been claimed — which setup cannot see, and which
  fails when mDNS is off or the name is already taken on the network. The summary
  now shows only addresses it verified.

## August 9, 2026 - The browser tool goes, and macOS installs work in a plain shell (v0.1.321)

- **The cloud-browser login profiles are gone.** They did not work reliably
  enough to keep, and they were the most expensive thing left: playwright's
  20MB driver plus a ~150MB Chromium that setup never installed, so a default
  install paid for the feature and still could not run it. Anything like this
  belongs in a plugin system, added on top at runtime, rather than carried by
  every install on the chance someone wants it.
- **`omg` and `lfg` work in a plain terminal on macOS.** They were symlinks to a
  `#!/usr/bin/env bun` script, and setup deliberately does not edit your shell
  profile there — so both failed with "env: bun: No such file or directory" on
  machines where bun was installed and working. Setup now writes a launcher that
  finds bun the way the npm CLI does.
- **`omg setup` no longer dies claiming bun is missing** when it is installed.
  The check ran one line before the code that adds `~/.bun/bin` to `PATH`.
- `node_modules` is 66MB to 46MB; nothing in it is larger than 7MB.

## August 9, 2026 - Starting an opencode session from a finding works again (v0.1.320)

- **"thinkingLevel is not supported for opencode sessions" is fixed.** Replying
  to an auto finding with opencode selected failed outright: the sheet correctly
  sends no thinking level for a backend that has no reasoning knob, but the
  launch then filled it back in from the auto agent the finding came from. The
  level is now judged against the backend that actually runs, not the one the
  finding originated on.
- **Switching an auto agent to opencode no longer corrupts it.** Saving an edit
  kept the thinking level the agent held as claude, writing a record that passed
  validation on the way in and failed later at launch. A backend switch now drops
  a level the new backend cannot take — including a claude `max` carried onto
  grok, whose CLI exits on it rather than ignoring it.

## August 9, 2026 - Two features stop shipping to people who do not use them (v0.1.319)

- **The WhatsApp bridge is gone.** It was 17MB of every install — baileys plus
  protobufjs, libsignal and a rust bridge — for a sidecar nobody was running.
  The docs already called it optional; it just was not optional in the bundle,
  because the command imported baileys at the top level. Removed outright rather
  than made opt-in: keeping a dependency, an install flag and a code path alive
  for a feature with no users is a poor trade.
- **The browser tool installs on request.** playwright's driver was 20MB, the
  largest single item left — and the ~150MB Chromium it drives was never
  installed by setup at all, so a default install paid for the feature without
  being able to run it. `OMG_INSTALL_BROWSER=1 omg setup` now installs both
  halves and remembers the choice. Calling the tool without it says so, with the
  command to fix it.
- Together with v0.1.318, `node_modules` is down from 244MB to 66MB, and no
  single dependency is larger than 7MB.

## August 8, 2026 - Installs get smaller again: 61MB to 34MB (v0.1.318)

- **Source maps are no longer shipped.** They were 27MB of a 61MB download —
  700 files, 117MB unpacked — and nothing fetches them: the build marks them
  `hidden`, so no bundle references one. They exist to map a minified frame back
  to source while debugging, which pays off in a checkout (that builds its own),
  not on a release install that ships no source to map back to. Still generated,
  just not shipped.
- **pi is installed on request rather than bundled.** Its provider layer
  declares eleven SDKs — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google GenAI, Mistral, Bedrock,
  OpenTelemetry — which is where the 24MB of Mistral in every install came from,
  for a provider omg.dev never calls. Together that was 115MB of a 244MB
  `node_modules`, for one optional agent among eight. Install it with
  `OMG_INSTALL_PI=1 omg setup`, or from Settings → Coding agents; the choice is
  recorded so later updates keep it.
- A fresh install is now **34MB to download and 138MB on disk**, down from
  ~2GB and 1.2GB this morning.

## August 8, 2026 - A switch for the named local URL, and one CLI surface (v0.1.317)

- **Settings has a switch for the named local URL.** Turn `omg.local` on or off
  while the server runs — it takes effect immediately, because advertising the
  name is just registering an mDNS record. A machine that cannot do it (anything
  but macOS) shows the switch disabled and says why, rather than offering a
  control that silently does nothing.
- **`omg computer <verb>` works on this CLI too.** `omg` may be this command or
  the omg.dev CLI depending on which comes first on your PATH, and only one
  spelling can work with both — so machine verbs now answer to either form. The
  bare verbs are unchanged, so the service unit and existing MCP registrations
  keep working.
- **`connect status --json`** gives the omg.dev CLI a real contract to read.
  It previously recovered the relay URL by pattern-matching this command's
  English, which the rename to omg.dev had just changed underneath it.
- Fixed: bootstrap dropped data it had already gathered, and `omg update`
  reported "LFG" in the one message a successful update prints.

## August 8, 2026 - Fix: setup failed when an agent CLI was missing (v0.1.316)

- **`omg setup` aborted with "setup failed at line 472" on any machine missing
  an agent CLI**, which is most machines. Introduced in v0.1.315 alongside the
  quieter setup output: the new probe returned a non-zero status in a context
  where `set -e` treats that as fatal, so the first agent you did not have
  ended the run. Existing installs kept working; only re-running setup broke.

## August 8, 2026 - `omg update`, and a setup that reports instead of narrating (v0.1.315)

- **`omg update` updates this machine.** It was reachable before — a button in
  the web UI, and `omg setup` picking up a release on its way past — but neither
  is what you reach for in a terminal, and `setup` reads like it might
  reconfigure the box. `omg update --check` reports without changing anything.
- **Setup's output says what happened.** It used to end with a warning for every
  agent CLI you had not installed, another for Tailscale Serve being off when
  off is the default, and a "Next steps" block that had drifted out of date —
  burying the one thing you want, which URL to open. It now prints the URLs,
  which agents are ready, which can be added and where, and how to restart and
  read logs.
- **The named URL is not described as needing sudo any more.** Since v0.1.313
  the server advertises `omg.local` over mDNS on macOS, so it is already live by
  the time setup finishes.
- **Hermes is gone.** It had already been dropped as an agent kind, but setup
  still offered to install it and warned when it was missing.
- Downloads show a progress bar instead of six columns of transfer statistics.

## August 8, 2026 - A fresh install opens, and cleanup stays in its lane (v0.1.314)

- **"Choose a project" no longer opens stuck on "Opening…".** On a brand new
  install, before anyone touched a setting, the picker showed an empty listing
  and "folder does not exist". `.env` is copied from `.env.example`, which
  ships `OMG_REPOS_ROOT=` as documentation, and that empty value was read as a
  deliberate answer rather than an unfilled placeholder — so the server had no
  repos root and answered its own default-directory request with a 400.
- The picker's fallback, added in v0.1.305 so a missing folder could not strand
  the drawer, landed on the same error: it falls back *to* the repos root, and
  the repos root was the thing that was empty.
- Existing installs are repaired by updating — no `.env` edit needed. Re-running
  `omg setup` also fills the placeholder in place.
- **The sweeper no longer deletes worktrees it didn't create.** `~/lfg-worktrees`
  is a shared directory, and the background cleanup treated everything in it as
  its own — so a hand-made worktree, release checkout or clone parked there was
  removed within minutes, dirty or not. It now only reclaims worktrees it
  provisioned itself and leaves everything else alone permanently.
- **Uncommitted work is never deleted.** Even for its own worktrees, the sweeper
  now checks for uncommitted changes before removing one and holds it back if
  there are any. The liveness checks it used before were heuristics; this is a
  fact about the contents. Ignored files don't count, so a clean-but-built
  worktree is still cleaned up.
- **Cleanup no longer piles onto server restarts.** The first sweep ran 30
  seconds after startup — before session recovery had re-adopted running
  sessions, when the most worktrees look abandoned. Every multi-worktree
  deletion we observed happened within 40 seconds of a restart. It now waits
  five minutes.

## August 8, 2026 - omg.local, with no password prompt (v0.1.313)

- **The web UI answers on `http://omg.local:8766` on macOS.** No sudo, no
  `/etc/hosts` edit, no DNS record, and it works offline. omg.dev advertises the
  name over mDNS while the server is running, pointing it at `127.0.0.1` — the
  server stays bound to loopback exactly as before. Stopping the server stops
  the name resolving, which leaves nothing behind to clean up. Set
  `OMG_MDNS_HOSTNAME` to pick a different name, or empty to turn it off.
- macOS only for now. Doing this on Linux would mean installing avahi-daemon,
  and a first install should not drag in a system daemon for a nicer URL —
  Linux keeps the opt-in `/etc/hosts` entry.
- **Setup prefers a DNS name that already points at loopback** over editing
  `/etc/hosts`, when one exists, and only trusts it when *every* address it
  resolves to is loopback.
- Note `.local` is shared with your network, and browsers only treat
  `localhost` and loopback IPs as secure origins — **install the PWA from
  `localhost:8766`**, not from `omg.local`, or the service worker will not
  register.

## August 8, 2026 - Queue a message without cutting the turn off (v0.1.312)

- **Cmd/Ctrl+Enter queues a message instead of interrupting.** Holding the send
  button has always queued behind the running turn, but the gesture is
  pointer-only, so a laptop had no way to reach it — typing and pressing Enter
  always interrupted. Plain Enter still steers.
- **Queueing now tells you it happened.** Steering and queueing looked identical
  at the moment you sent; the difference only showed up later, in whether the
  agent's work survived. A queue that lands mid-turn now says so once. An idle
  session stays quiet, because there the two modes do the same thing.
- Worth knowing which you want: steering interrupts, and interrupting cancels
  tool calls that are already running.
- **Install downloads are much smaller.** The published linux-x64 bundle drops
  from 386MB to 61MB, and the dependencies it unpacks from 1221MB to 251MB. It
  was carrying private copies of the Claude, Codex and OpenCode binaries, which
  omg.dev never used — every backend already prefers the agent installed on your
  own machine. Install agents from Settings → Coding agents, as before.

## August 8, 2026 - A steered turn stops repeating itself (v0.1.311)

- **Steering a running turn no longer duplicates it down the chat.** Sending a
  second message while the agent was still working — a follow-up, a correction,
  an interrupt — made the rest of that turn repeat itself in the pane: the same
  reasoning block, the same tool calls and the same paragraph, over and over,
  growing with every chunk until the turn ended.
- The transcript itself was always correct — one copy of everything — so
  reopening the session cleaned it up. Only the live view was affected, which is
  why the repeat came and went and was so hard to catch in the act.
- A steering send now rides the stream that is already open instead of starting
  a second one. Both messages still reach the agent, and the turn renders once.

## August 8, 2026 - A quiet install and an update that stops doing the work twice (v0.1.310)

- **Updating no longer re-downloads the dependencies it just downloaded.** The
  per-platform bundles from v0.1.309 arrive with `node_modules` already resolved
  and pruned for your machine, and setup skips `bun install` when it sees them —
  but the in-app updater deleted that tree and re-resolved the whole graph from
  npm, musl builds and all. A bundle install has an empty Bun cache, so updating
  was slower than installing. It now keeps what the bundle shipped. (Installs
  already on v0.1.309 pay the old cost once more, on the way to this release.)
- **Both paths clear the old dependency tree before extracting**, so an update
  can no longer leave behind files the new release deleted, and a
  platform-neutral bundle landing on an existing install still gets the install
  it needs instead of running new code against old dependencies.
- **A first install touches nothing you did not ask for.** Tailscale is no
  longer installed on every Linux box: it is behind `OMG_INSTALL_TAILSCALE`,
  never prompts for an auth key, and cannot fail the install. Piping setup into
  `bash` used to end with a daemon nobody asked for and a failed install, since
  the key prompt has no TTY there. The `omg.local` hosts entry is opt-in for the
  same reason — no sudo prompt for a cosmetic URL. Both extras are printed at
  the end so they stay discoverable.
- **Setup stops overwriting commands and shell lines it does not own.** It
  linked `omg` and `lfg` with `ln -sf`, which silently replaced any other `omg`
  on your PATH; it now writes only when the path is free or already ours, and
  warns otherwise. PATH lines appended to `.bashrc` / `.zshrc` are tagged, so
  `omg uninstall` can take exactly its own lines back out.
- The README offers both `bun` and `npm` for installing the CLI.

## August 8, 2026 - Installs stop downloading what they cannot run (v0.1.309)

- **A first install no longer resolves dependencies on your machine.** Every
  release now publishes a bundle per platform — `omg-linux-x64`,
  `omg-linux-arm64`, `omg-darwin-x64`, `omg-darwin-arm64` — with `node_modules`
  already installed for that target. Setup downloads the one matching your
  machine and skips `bun install` entirely.
- **667 MB of every Linux install was unusable.** npm gates platform packages
  with the `libc` field, and Bun filters `optionalDependencies` by `os` and
  `cpu` but not `libc` — so glibc machines also downloaded the musl builds of
  the Claude agent SDK, both opencode variants, and sharp's libvips. There is no
  `bun install --libc` to opt out. Release bundles are pruned instead.
- **The platform bundles were already being built and thrown away.** v0.1.308
  built all four, but the release workflow's upload list never named them, so
  only the platform-neutral bundle shipped.
- **A named local URL.** Setup maps `omg.local` to `127.0.0.1` so the web UI has
  a memorable address, without binding the server to any non-loopback
  interface. Install the PWA from `localhost` — a `.local` origin over plain
  HTTP is not a secure context, so service workers will not register there.
- **`omg uninstall` cleans up after itself properly.** It removed only the `lfg`
  command while setup installs both names, leaving `omg` on PATH pointing at a
  deleted file, where it would shadow a later reinstall. It now removes both,
  plus the hosts entry, and leaves alone any symlink it does not own.
- Product prose is `omg.dev` throughout, the README carries the real omg.dev
  mark, and the third-party cloud-hosting guide is gone.

## August 8, 2026 - The @omg-dev packages actually reach npm (v0.1.308)

- **`@omg-dev/protocol`, `@omg-dev/client`, `@omg-dev/react` and `@omg-dev/app`
  are on npm as of this release.** The v0.1.306 notes announced the move, but no
  release had managed to publish: `npm publish` was handed the tarball as
  `dist/omg-dev-protocol-….tgz`, which npm reads as a GitHub `owner/repo`
  shorthand rather than a file, so it tried to clone it over SSH and failed on a
  public key. Nothing was ever half-published — the packages publish in
  dependency order, so the failure hit the first one and stopped there.

## August 8, 2026 - Browsing files works on a phone (v0.1.307)

- **The file tree gets the whole screen, and so does the file.** Files opened
  on a phone as a 208px tree strip stacked over a file view with about five
  lines in it. Below the tablet breakpoint it is now two screens: the tree
  fills the sheet, tapping a file pushes it full-screen with its own back bar,
  and Back returns to the tree exactly where you left it — same selection,
  same unsent edit. Desktop keeps the two-pane layout unchanged.
- **The sheet stops fighting the keyboard and the safe areas.** It follows the
  visible viewport, so opening the keyboard to write a note shrinks it instead
  of pushing "Send to agent" underneath. Headers clear the status bar, the
  bottom of the sheet clears the home indicator, and the path breadcrumb
  scrolls sideways on one line instead of wrapping the header down the screen.
- **Tapping the search box or the editor no longer zooms the page.** Both are
  drawn inside a shadow root that the app's 16px-on-touch rule could not
  reach, so iOS zoomed in on focus and left no way back out.
- Bigger hit targets on the header controls, a full-width send button, and the
  Files and Review pills wrap instead of clipping on a narrow screen.

## August 8, 2026 - The embeddable packages move to npm as @omg-dev (v0.1.306)

- **`@omg-dev/protocol`, `@omg-dev/client`, `@omg-dev/react` and `@omg-dev/app`
  are published to npm.** `npm install @omg-dev/app @omg-dev/client` is now all
  it takes to embed the application. Until now these were not on the registry at
  all — each release attached tarballs to its GitHub release and rewrote the
  packages' own dependencies into download URLs, so embedding meant pinning
  asset links by hand.
- **A release installs as one consistent set.** The four are versioned together
  off the release tag and depend on each other by exact version, so
  `@omg-dev/client` can never resolve against a `@omg-dev/protocol` it did not
  ship with — a mismatch that would typecheck and then disagree on the wire.
- **The old `@lfg-dev` names are gone rather than aliased.** Nothing was ever
  published under them, so there is nobody to keep compatible. Exported types
  and components follow the same rename: `OmgAppSurface`, `OmgTransport`,
  `OmgSettingsPage` and the rest.
- Each tag still attaches its package tarballs to the GitHub release, as the
  record of exactly what that version shipped.

## August 8, 2026 - The folder picker finds its way back (v0.1.305)

- **A deleted project folder no longer traps the picker.** "Choose a project"
  opens on the folder you used last, remembered in the browser and never
  rechecked. Once that folder was deleted or renamed — a pruned worktree, a
  repo moved on disk — opening the picker showed "folder does not exist" over
  an empty list, with the header stuck on "Opening…" and both **New Folder**
  and **Use This Folder** greyed out. Closing and reopening returned to the
  same dead end. The picker now drops back to your projects folder and says
  which path went missing, so you can navigate on from there. Clicking into a
  folder that genuinely fails still reports the error where it happened
  instead of jumping you elsewhere.

## August 8, 2026 - The folder picker can no longer take the app down (v0.1.304)

- **Browsing for a project folder can't crash the app anymore.** The picker
  read the folder list straight off whatever the server sent back, so a reply
  that arrived without one took out the entire page — App is the root of the
  router, so a single missing list meant the crash screen instead of the app.
  It now falls back to an empty list and keeps the "This folder is empty" hint
  for when the folder really is empty.
- **`uninstall --purge` accepts an install under either name.** Its safety
  guard insisted the manifest say `lfg`, so a renamed install would have been
  told it is "not an OMG installation" — about its own directory. It now
  recognises both names, and still refuses anything that is neither.

## August 8, 2026 - A new install is OMG all the way down (v0.1.303)

- **A fresh machine now installs as `omg`.** It lands in `~/omg`, runs as
  `omg.service` (or the `dev.omg.serve` launch agent on macOS), and puts both
  `omg` and `lfg` on your `PATH`. The last places still saying LFG on a brand
  new box are gone.
- **An existing machine is left exactly where it is.** A box already running
  from `~/lfg` under `lfg.service` keeps both names, and re-running setup will
  not move it. Renaming a live install means stopping the control plane that is
  currently working and hoping its replacement comes up — not something worth
  doing to a machine that is fine, and not something you should have to think
  about before updating.
- **Everything that restarts the service now asks which one is installed**
  rather than assuming. That was a real trap: the deploy script restarted a
  hardcoded `lfg.service`, so on a newly-named box every future deploy would
  have reported success while restarting nothing.
- **Setup accepts `OMG_*` variables.** `OMG_PORT=9000 curl … | bash` works, and
  every older `LFG_*` name is still read.
- **Uninstall now removes both.** A box that was installed under the old name
  and reinstalled under the new one could carry two service units; removing
  only one left the other enabled and still starting a server at boot.
- Releases publish `omg-bundle.tar.gz`, with the old `lfg-bundle.tar.gz` name
  kept alongside it so installers already on a machine keep resolving.

## August 8, 2026 - A missing model list now repairs itself (v0.1.302)

- **Installing an agent CLI after LFG is running no longer takes until the
  next morning to show up.** LFG asks each agent CLI what models it offers a
  few seconds after starting. If a CLI was not installed or signed in yet, that
  failure was recorded as the answer and nothing asked again until 08:00 the
  following day — so a box set up in the wrong order, most often a fresh
  workspace, showed a stale built-in model list for up to 24 hours no matter
  what you installed in the meantime. Failed lookups are now retried on a
  widening interval that tops out at half an hour, so a CLI installed at any
  point is picked up on its own. A harness that has no model-list command is
  left alone rather than retried forever, and a retry no longer disturbs the
  providers that already answered.

## August 8, 2026 - Read and edit the files an agent touched (v0.1.301)

- **There is now a Files panel in the chat.** The diffs bar only ever showed
  what changed, so a session where an agent wrote three new documents left you
  with an all-green diff and no way to read anything else in the checkout. Files
  lists the whole tree — 1,200-odd paths for a typical session — with git status
  badges on what the agent touched, and opens any file syntax-highlighted.
- **You can browse out of the session, too.** The breadcrumb walks up to the
  worktrees directory and the home directory, so a file that lives next to the
  session is reachable without a terminal. Browsing stops at a ceiling, and
  secrets — `~/.ssh`, `.env`, keys and certificates — are refused at every level.
- **Edits go to the agent, not behind its back.** Editing a file and pressing
  "Send to agent" turns the change into a patch and queues it as a message, so
  the agent applies it with its own tools. Nothing writes to disk underneath a
  running session, and the change shows up in the transcript instead of
  appearing from nowhere.
- **Opening the app is no slower.** The tree, the viewer and the editor each
  load only when first used; the startup bundle grows by about 200 bytes.
- **Typing no longer triggers shortcuts.** Keystrokes inside the new tree search
  and editor were also reaching the app's global hotkeys, so typing could open
  dialogs or jump between sessions mid-word. Every hotkey guard now sees focus
  correctly.

## August 8, 2026 - One name everywhere, and agents can run the schedule (v0.1.300)

- **The agent toolset is now `omg_*`.** Every tool an agent calls was named
  `lfg_*` while the product, the site and the settings had already become OMG,
  so the one surface an agent reads all day was the last one still disagreeing.
  The MCP server is registered as `omg`, so tools now read
  `mcp__omg__omg_ship`, and the launch contract is the OMG runtime contract.
- **Nothing has to be restarted for this.** Sessions already running keep the
  tool list they started with, and their `lfg_*` calls are translated at the
  connection instead of failing. New sessions see only the new names, so the
  catalog does not carry both spellings forever.
- **Agents can now manage the scheduled fleet.** Auto agents — a prompt plus a
  cron schedule, reporting findings — were reachable only from the web UI, so
  asking an agent to "check this every morning" had nowhere to go. There are
  now tools to list, compose, save, run, and delete them, and to read and
  resolve their findings. They call the same routes the UI does, so an agent
  and a human are editing one fleet.
- **`omg` is now the command.** `lfg` keeps working as an alias, and the older
  `LFG_*` variables are still read.
- Artifacts published before the rename keep their theming: the older
  `--lfg-artifact-*` style variables are still supplied alongside the new
  `--omg-artifact-*` ones.

## August 8, 2026 - Every open dependency advisory is closed (v0.1.299)

- **The three open Dependabot alerts are fixed.** All of them sat in the mobile
  app's Expo toolchain: `js-yaml` (a YAML document could burn CPU quadratically
  on `!!omap`), `brace-expansion` (a glob pattern could exhaust memory), and
  `uuid` (a missing bounds check when a caller supplies its own buffer). The
  first two only needed a lockfile bump. `uuid` needed an override — the one
  package that pulls it in still pins a 7.x range with no backported fix, and
  npm's own suggestion was to downgrade Expo by four majors. An iOS prebuild
  was run end to end against the patched tree to confirm the native project
  still generates correctly.
- **Two more advisories that Dependabot cannot see are fixed too.** It cannot
  read `bun.lock`, so it never reported the root `nanoid` (a custom generator
  could loop forever) — now patched. The `brace-expansion` override was also
  pinned *at* the vulnerable version; installs happened to resolve above it, so
  the audit stayed green while the floor invited the bug straight back. Both
  floors now sit on patched releases.

## August 8, 2026 - A new account sees the whole free model tier (v0.1.298)

- **The model picker no longer hides most of the free tier on a fresh
  install.** OpenCode publishes seven models that need no credentials, but a
  brand new account saw exactly one of them and reasonably concluded that was
  the entire free offering. Live discovery had always listed all seven — it
  just does not run until a few seconds after boot, and anyone who opened the
  picker before then got a built-in fallback list that held a single entry.
  That list now carries all seven, so the first look is the true one. The
  default is unchanged.
- **The README now leads with installing the open-source project.** The
  one-line `curl` install is the first thing on the page, followed by what
  `lfg` is for and why you would want it; install management and the hosted
  option moved below. It also states plainly that you bring your own agent
  accounts, and that everything works forever without an account. The
  from-source steps had you `cd` into a directory that the clone does not
  create — fixed.

## August 8, 2026 - Dictation shows words as you speak on hosted workspaces (v0.1.297)

- **Dictation is live on a hosted workspace.** Words now appear while you are
  still talking. Until now a hosted workspace held no speech key, so the
  browser's realtime socket was refused the moment it opened and every take
  quietly degraded to uploading the whole clip after you stopped — a blank
  composer while you spoke, the transcript arriving all at once at the end,
  and nothing on screen explaining why. Audio now streams to the platform's
  own relay instead, which keeps the provider credential host-side, so there
  is no key to enter and nothing to configure.
- **A dead speech provider can no longer be chosen.** Three separate defaults
  used to pin a keyless machine to a provider that could not answer: the
  default was a fixed name, a previously saved choice was honoured even with
  nothing behind it, and both fallbacks named one provider outright. Each now
  resolves against what is actually available.
- **When dictation cannot stream, the mic says so.** The button reads
  "transcribes after you stop" rather than looking like it has hung.

## August 7, 2026 - Settings move to the OMG_ prefix (v0.1.296)

- **Configuration variables are now named `OMG_*`.** New installs are seeded
  with `OMG_HOST`, `OMG_PORT` and the rest. Every older `LFG_` name is still
  read, so an existing `.env` keeps working exactly as before and needs no
  migration — if a name is set both ways, `OMG_` wins.
- The finished-install summary prints `http://localhost:8766` beside the
  loopback address, so there is a named URL to click.
- Setup's own messages now use one consistent spelling of the product name.
- **The dependency audit is green again after three new high-severity
  advisories landed.** Patched transitive versions of `ip-address`, `js-yaml`,
  and `undici` now cover an SSRF parsing mismatch, a YAML CPU-exhaustion path,
  and a cache disclosure/crash issue. Root overrides keep future installs from
  silently resolving back to vulnerable releases.

## August 7, 2026 - Sessions ship again (v0.1.295)

- **A voice recording can be thrown away with one tap.** While you're dictating,
  a small ✕ slides up out of the mic button — tap it and the take is discarded
  and the composer goes back to whatever it said before you started talking.
  Tapping the mic still sends, so until now backing out of a bad take meant
  either holding and dragging away or reaching for the Esc key; on a phone there
  was no way at all once a tap-to-record take was underway.
- **Finished sessions post to Shipped again.** The Shipped feed had gone silent
  since August 5 — not because posting was broken, but because the instructions
  telling agents to post had been deleted. A prompt cleanup that split the old
  `lfg_output` tool into ordinary replies plus `lfg_ship` dropped both shipping
  bullets from the agent contract on its way through, so agents simply never
  learned that shipping was part of finishing a job.
- Shipping guidance is now stated three ways — in the runtime contract, in the
  MCP server instructions, and as a promoted capability — along with the
  "Shipped is not deployed" rule that went missing with it.
- Setup notes for macOS: `scripts/setup.sh` no longer passes GNU-only flags to
  bsdtar.

## August 7, 2026 - Click the thinking pill to get the slider (v0.1.294)

- **The thinking control now opens on a plain click.** Tapping or clicking the
  "Thinking" pill parks the effort slider open as an ordinary popover: point at
  the bar or click a level name and it applies straight away. Previously the
  pill only answered to hold-and-slide, so a click did nothing — and letting go
  of a half-finished drag left the level unchanged.
- Escape, a click anywhere outside, or a second click on the pill puts the
  slider away without changing anything.
- Hold-and-slide is unchanged, so the one-motion gesture on mobile still works
  exactly as before.

## August 7, 2026 - The Start button holds still while you pick effort (v0.1.292)

- **Holding Start to slide the thinking level no longer restyles the button.**
  It kept its ring, grew slightly, swapped its icon and replaced "Start" with
  the level name, which nudged the buttons beside it on every step. The button
  now looks exactly as it does at rest; the floating scrubber still shows the
  live level.

## August 7, 2026 - Mounted settings pages really do end where the page ends (v0.1.293)

- **Third and last piece of the mounted-page scroll fix.** The mobile
  viewport-sizing pass — the one that keeps the standalone app pinned to the
  visible band on iOS — was still stretching a host-mounted page to exactly one
  screen, which is the same clamp in JavaScript. It now leaves host-mounted
  pages alone; only the app that owns the viewport gets pinned.

## August 7, 2026 - Mounted settings pages keep their bottom margin (v0.1.291)

- **Follow-up to v0.1.290.** The mounted pages scrolled to the end, but the
  last row sat flush against the bottom edge on the tallest of them because
  the page's box still measured one screen tall. Fixed — the host's page
  padding is back under the last card.

## August 7, 2026 - Mounted settings pages scroll all the way down (v0.1.290)

- **A settings page mounted inside another product no longer cuts off at one
  screen.** The mounted page reused the standalone app's full-viewport shell,
  which clips anything taller than the window — so on omg's Storage page the
  scroll stopped dead partway through and the last cards (resource pressure,
  and everything under it) were unreachable. Mounted pages now size to their
  content and scroll with the host page.
- The blank band that used to sit under the last card on those pages is gone
  too: it reserved room for a floating composer the mounted page doesn't have.
- **A recurring high-severity finding can no longer be muted.** Dismissing a
  HIGH finding used to tell the next automated run not to raise it again, so a
  daily check that stayed red went unnoticed for a day. High severity always
  resurfaces and escalates on repeat now; low/medium dismissals still stick.
  Findings can also finally be marked resolved — `lfg agents auto resolve <id>`.

## August 6, 2026 - No more "Welcome, Unassigned" (v0.1.289)

- **The mobile Live header stops greeting people by a filter label.** When
  nothing identifies the viewer — a hosted surface that passes no viewer, or
  omg.dev's signed-out preview — the welcome fell through to the roster's
  "unassigned" label, so visitors were greeted with "Welcome, Unassigned".
- No identity now simply means no name: "Welcome", and the agent-needs-you
  headlines drop their name prefix the same way. Signed-in and hosted-viewer
  greetings are unchanged.

## August 6, 2026 - Newly started sessions can post images without being told who they are (v0.1.288)

- **Finishes the image fix from v0.1.287.** That release taught the server to
  recognize which session was calling, but the matching change on the agent
  side landed in the backend that writes reports rather than the one that runs
  your sessions — so a freshly started session still couldn't identify itself,
  and an agent had to name its own session id by hand to show you a screenshot.
  Sessions now register themselves at launch, verified end to end on a real
  session that displayed an image without naming itself.
- Both agent launchers share one registration path now, guarded by a check that
  fails if a future launcher is added without it — which is exactly how the
  first attempt slipped through.

## August 6, 2026 - Screenshots show up in transcripts again (v0.1.287)

- **Agents can post images and videos to a session again.** Since August 1,
  every `lfg_display_image` and `lfg_display_video` call had been failing with
  "sessionId required" and creating nothing, so screenshots an agent captured
  to prove a change worked silently never reached the transcript — you just
  saw the work described, never shown. Publishing HTML artifacts, asking a
  question, and sending media back to the originating channel were failing the
  same way.
- The cause was a performance change that moved MCP out of one process per
  session and into the server. That collapsed 14 near-identical processes into
  one and saved real memory, but a per-session process also carried the one
  thing the shared one couldn't: which session was calling. Sessions now
  identify themselves on each request, so the memory win stays and the tools
  work.
- **A session can no longer act on another session's behalf.** The same missing
  caller identity had quietly turned the ownership checks into no-ops, letting
  session-owned actions target any session at all. They're enforced again.
- **Sessions report why a turn failed** instead of just naming the failure
  type, and transcript indexing no longer errors when its database connection
  is rebound.

## August 6, 2026 - Shipped notifications open, and live worktrees stop vanishing (v0.1.286)

- Tapping a **Shipped** notification now opens the finished session for review
  instead of failing. The notification says "tap to review the finished
  session", but posting to Shipped can also close that session — so by the time
  you tapped, the link had nothing live to point at and gave up with "That
  session is no longer running". It now falls back to the same read-only review
  the in-app Shipped row has always opened, and you can reply there to pick the
  conversation back up.
- **Sessions no longer lose their working folder while they're running.** The
  cleanup that reclaims finished sessions' folders judged "still alive" by tmux,
  which agents on the default backend don't use — so after a restart it could
  delete the folder out from under a working agent, uncommitted changes and all.
  It now checks whether anything is actually running in the folder first. Two
  sessions were lost to this earlier today; the sweep immediately after the fix
  reclaimed nothing while every live session stayed intact.

## August 6, 2026 - Readable session titles in Resume (v0.1.285)

- The **Resume** sheet, and session cards generally, now show what you actually
  asked for. Sessions started through LFG had been titled and previewed with
  the runtime instructions LFG prepends to the first message, so the list read
  as page after page of identical `=== LFG RUNTIME CONTRACT (capability ve…`
  rows with no way to tell them apart. Rebuilding the list from real history
  went from 32 of 200 sessions unreadable to none.
- Applies across Claude, Codex, Grok and Cursor sessions, and to the titles
  shown on a brand-new session before its transcript exists. Existing sessions
  with a stored boilerplate title are repaired automatically on upgrade.

## August 6, 2026 - Triage starts in the right folder (v0.1.284)

- **Triage & execute** now starts its session in the same project folder the
  findings are listed under, so it shows up in the Live list and rail group you
  pressed the button in. Previously a batch spanning more than one agent folder
  — or any agent without a folder — fell back to the last repo you happened to
  open, and the run appeared under an unrelated project.
- Headless Chrome no longer leaks between agent sessions: every managed session
  gets a browser idle timeout and closes its browser on teardown.

## August 6, 2026 - One-click auto finding triage (v0.1.283)

- Open auto-agent findings now have a **Triage & execute** shortcut. It starts
  one visible parent session that verifies the findings, groups related work,
  dismisses confirmed noise, and launches linked LFG agents for actionable
  groups.
- Triage runs preserve the human decision boundary: product, pricing,
  destructive, and genuinely ambiguous calls stay open for review, while
  scoped project runs do not pull in unrelated findings.

## August 5, 2026 - Horizontal effort bar restored, upright one tracks your thumb (v0.1.282)

- **Fixed the Thinking pill's horizontal bar rendering as an empty strip.** The
  upright bar added for Start in v0.1.281 collapsed the horizontal one to zero
  width — the level names showed but the bar itself was gone.
- Holding **Start** now tracks your thumb **absolutely**: the level next to your
  finger on the bar is the level you get, rather than counting steps from wherever
  you pressed. Until your finger actually reaches the bar the level stays put, so
  a press and release with no real drag can never launch at the wrong effort.

## August 5, 2026 - Start's effort picker stands upright (v0.1.281)

- Holding **Start** now raises an **upright** effort bar you scrub by sliding
  up and down, instead of side to side. Start sits in the bottom-right corner
  where there was barely any room to swipe sideways, so the deeper levels were
  awkward to reach.
- The bar is parked **directly above the button**, so your thumb slides along
  the bar itself rather than beside it, and one level of finger movement lands
  on exactly one stop. Every level is named down the left with the live one lit.
- Sideways drift no longer disturbs the choice — only up and down counts.
- The Thinking pill in the agent controls keeps its horizontal bar, and still
  takes a drag on either axis.
- Fixed effort names rendering inconsistently capitalised ("Low" next to
  "medium", "xhigh").

## August 5, 2026 - Thinking scrub no longer selects text (v0.1.280)

- Dragging out of **Start** to set the thinking effort no longer highlights the
  session list behind it. The drag now belongs entirely to the gesture — no
  text selection, no drag-image, and no long-press callout anywhere your finger
  travels — and everything returns to normal the moment you let go.

## August 5, 2026 - Hold Start to pick thinking effort (v0.1.279)

- **Press and hold Start** on the new-session composer to raise the thinking
  scrubber, slide to the effort you want, and release — the level is set and
  the session launches in one motion. A plain tap still starts immediately at
  the current effort. Picking a deeper effort no longer means a detour into the
  agent popover first.
- The scrubber now follows a drag **up as well as sideways**, whichever you
  move first. Start sits in the bottom-right corner where there is no room left
  to drag sideways, so a horizontal-only scrub couldn't reach the top levels.
- **Every effort level is now named under the bar** while the labels fit, with
  the live one lit, plus tick marks for each stop. The panel header says which
  gesture is running, and the trigger shows the level under your finger instead
  of the old one — the Start button even takes on the effort colour as you go.
- **Escape cancels** an open scrubber, and cancelling no longer starts the
  session anyway on release.
- The Thinking pill is now a proper slider for keyboard and screen-reader
  users: arrow keys, Home, and End adjust it. The hold gesture used to be the
  only way to change effort.

## August 5, 2026 - Agents reason without hidden advisors (v0.1.278)

- LFG agents now handle technical reasoning directly instead of spawning a
  separate, persistent advisor session. The obsolete advisor MCP tools and
  voice-consult backend have been removed, so internal advisor sessions no
  longer appear in the live session list or consume an agent slot.

## August 5, 2026 - Updates no longer yank open sessions (v0.1.277)

- A new deploy no longer hard-reloads the app while you are using it. Mid-session
  you only get the **new version available** toast; the page reloads when you
  tap **Reload**, or automatically on the next cold open if an update was
  already waiting. Resume/focus and service-worker takeover no longer force a
  bounce mid-flow.

## August 5, 2026 - Ask-user replies no longer arrive empty (v0.1.276)

- Answering an agent question (tap an option or type a reply) now delivers the
  choice to the agent reliably. Multi-line answer envelopes could lose the
  trailing "Their reply" line on Grok while still counting as delivered, so the
  agent saw an empty body even though your pick was stored. The reply is now
  first in the envelope, and long messages confirm delivery with a head+tail
  check so a truncated send is retried instead of silently accepted.

## August 5, 2026 - Thinking scrub polish

- iOS haptics on the thinking scrubber work without the old `display:none`
  switch that blocked vibration on some devices.
- Stronger scrub haptics and a taller, borderless thinking matrix bar.

## August 5, 2026 - Repository renamed to BennyKok/omg.dev

- The public GitHub repository moved from `BennyKok/lfg` to
  [`BennyKok/omg.dev`](https://github.com/BennyKok/omg.dev).
- Old web and git URLs redirect automatically. Install/release defaults and docs
  now point at the new path. The product CLI remains `lfg`.

## August 5, 2026 - No false "did not finish loading" (v0.1.275)

- Cold loads that take a few seconds (phone + Tailscale, or a hard reload after
  an update) no longer flash **lfg did not finish loading** and then the real
  UI a moment later. The boot shell cancels that recovery as soon as the app
  module starts, and only escalates after 12s if the shell never arrives.

## August 5, 2026 - Reload actually reloads (v0.1.274)

- Tapping **Reload** on the "new version available" toast now hard-refreshes the
  app. After the recent service-worker cleanup, that button only asked the
  worker to take over — and a session latch could block later reloads — so you
  often had to close and reopen the app to pick up a deploy.

## August 5, 2026 - Compact thinking scrub labels (v0.1.273)

- Scrub card is tighter: drops Faster/Deeper, centers the current level, and
  shows the agent’s real min/max effort names at the ends (e.g. low · xhigh).

## August 5, 2026 - Thinking scrub card really solid (v0.1.272)

- Scrub overlay uses a dedicated opaque panel class (dark `#1c1c1e` fill +
  border + shadow) so it no longer floats as bare labels over the composer.

## August 5, 2026 - Solid thinking scrub card (v0.1.271)

- Thinking scrubber panel uses a solid popover background and border again so
  it reads clearly over the transcript (not a near-transparent frosted wash).

## August 5, 2026 - Thinking scrub dial-back (v0.1.270)

- Restored the frosted card behind the Thinking scrubber, and dialed scrub
  sensitivity back to the original hold-then-slide feel (more travel per level).

## August 5, 2026 - Lighter, snappier thinking scrub (v0.1.269)

- Thinking scrub overlay no longer sits in a bordered card — just the matrix,
  thumb, and labels floating over the UI.
- Scrubbing is more sensitive: about half the travel per level, and a short
  horizontal drag starts the gesture immediately instead of waiting out a hold.

## August 5, 2026 - Pixel-matrix thinking scrubber (v0.1.268)

- Hold-to-scrub Thinking control now matches the Codex density-track language:
  a thicker bar filled with rounded square cells, a chunky white squircle
  thumb, and a blue → fuchsia light-up as effort deepens.

## August 5, 2026 - Scheduled sessions run once (v0.1.267)

- Retrying the same scheduled occurrence now returns its original session
  instead of starting a duplicate after a control-plane restart or lost
  response.

## August 5, 2026 - Thinking scrubber glow-up (v0.1.266)

- Hold-to-scrub Thinking control now uses a thicker track and a rounded-square
  thumb instead of the thin dotted line. The fill borrows the send-message
  organic blue → indigo → violet → fuchsia wash, and the accent, glow, and
  level label morph hotter as effort intensifies.

## August 5, 2026 - One lfg on the splash (v0.1.265)

- Cold-load splash no longer stacks the app icon and a separate "lfg" wordmark.
  The logo already says the name, so the splash is just the mark and the
  progress bar.

## August 5, 2026 - Silent failures removed (v0.1.264)

- After the black home-screen fix, the recovery stack was a pile of one-shot
  cache markers, dual reload paths, and dead message handlers. Collapsed to one
  generation marker, a single controllerchange reload (in the boot shell), and
  the push-only worker that still takes over even when the Cache API is broken.
- Kept **/__lfg_pwa_diag** and the boot beacons — that page is how we debug the
  next silent black launch without guessing.
- Root cause, for the record: shell/asset fetch interception from day one (June)
  could answer navigations from a stale cache on iOS standalone; July 30 then
  put `skipWaiting` after cache work, so a Cache API error blocked the only
  escape forever. The real fix was remove the fetch handler + take over first;
  the rest of the stack was scaffolding.
- LFG-managed agents now communicate through their normal assistant replies
  instead of being forced to route every update through `lfg_output`, which
  caused some models to complete work without ever showing a response.
- The redundant `lfg_output` tool has been removed. Agents can still display
  local screenshots and recordings with the dedicated image and video tools.

## August 5, 2026 - Both resets in the campfire (v0.1.263)

- Focusing an agent in the Usage Campfire now keeps its nearest restore as the
  main countdown and shows every other reported window underneath. Session,
  5-hour, weekly, and 7-day resets are all visible together when available.

## August 5, 2026 - Finding sheet thinking matches the composer (v0.1.262)

- Opening a finding to launch a fix still used a plain Thinking dropdown. It
  now shares the same signal bars, level label, and hold-to-scrub control as
  the new-session composer and fork dialog — including auto-agent launch
  pickers that use the same row.

## August 5, 2026 - Found it: the black home-screen app (v0.1.261)

- A stale service worker could hold an installed app hostage forever. Tapping
  the icon fetched `/sw.js` two dozen times and never once requested the page:
  the old worker answered navigations from its own cache, so the app never
  loaded and nothing on the page could recover it.
- The replacement worker was failing to install. It did all its cache
  housekeeping *before* handing over control, so a single Cache API error (iOS
  storage pressure, an evicted bucket) aborted the install and left the old
  worker in charge. Takeover now happens first and unconditionally; cache work
  is best-effort and can never block it.
- The launch diagnostics now judge one launch at a time instead of pooling
  every device together — a healthy laptop tab was masking a failing phone.

## August 5, 2026 - A black PWA can finally say what went wrong (v0.1.260)

- New **/__lfg_pwa_diag** page reports how far a home-screen launch actually
  got, and names the layer that failed. Open it from any device — a phone stuck
  on a black screen cannot show you anything, so the answer lives on the server.
- It distinguishes the cases the last several fixes were guessing between: the
  phone never reached the box at all (network / Tailscale), the page was sent
  but never ran, the app bundle never evaluated, or the app mounted and painted
  nothing.
- The app now reports its boot phases as it starts, so "it's black" becomes a
  specific failure instead of a symptom.

## August 5, 2026 - Fresh home-screen install no longer reloads into black (v0.1.259)

- A brand-new Add to Home Screen was force-reloading on service-worker activate
  (and again on controllerchange), which left real iPhones on a solid black
  screen even after every icon was deleted. Fresh installs no longer reload;
  only upgrades that purge old shell caches do.
- Manifest start_url is plain `/` again (install id stays unique).

## August 5, 2026 - Home-screen loads like Safari (v0.1.258)

- The service worker no longer intercepts page or asset loads. That fetch
  handler is what made every iOS home-screen install solid black while Chrome
  and Safari on the same URL worked. The worker now only handles push
  notifications and wipes old caches on update.

## August 5, 2026 - Home-screen vs Safari are different (v0.1.257)

- On iPhone, resetting lfg in Safari does not reset the home-screen app — they
  keep separate website data. The reset page now detects which one you opened
  and tells you to delete the black icon before re-adding.
- A fresh Add to Home Screen uses a new install id so iOS does not revive the
  stuck profile.

## August 5, 2026 - PWA actually updates (v0.1.256)

- Home-screen LFG installs were keeping a cached service worker forever on iOS
  (`updateViaCache` default), so recovery code never arrived. Registration now
  opts out of HTTP caching for worker updates, new workers activate immediately,
  and every deploy rewrites the worker identity from the live index stamp.
- Open `/__lfg_pwa_reset` in Safari to force-clear a stuck install.
- A home-screen install that only showed solid black no longer falls back to an
  empty cached HTML document; the splash shows an "lfg" wordmark and recovery UI.

  falls back to an empty cached HTML document. The service worker only reuses
  a real app shell, otherwise it shows retry / clear-cache controls.
- The splash always paints the "lfg" wordmark (not only the icon), and if the
  app has not mounted after four seconds the recovery UI appears.

## August 4, 2026 - Black LFG PWA actually recovers (v0.1.255)

- A home-screen LFG app stuck on a black screen after a deploy now recovers
  even when the old shell never loaded the app bundle: the service worker
  registers from the page itself, clears the dead shell cache, and reloads.
- Offline launches without a usable shell show a retry / clear-cache screen
  instead of a solid black window.
- If the black splash is still up after ten seconds, the page now shows an
  explicit recovery UI (retry / reset install data) instead of hanging forever
  — including when site data was already cleared and the app still never mounts.

## August 4, 2026 - Black LFG PWA self-heals (v0.1.254)

- An installed LFG home-screen app that was stuck on a black screen after a
  deploy now clears its stale shell cache once and reloads onto the current
  build, instead of sitting on missing content-hashed chunks until you wipe
  the app by hand.

## August 4, 2026 - Settings controls stay clear (v0.1.253)

- Settings now shows a real on/off switch for pausing new agents, so the
  current state and the available action are visible without guessing that the
  whole row is clickable.
- Mobile secondary pages now leave enough room below the floating back header,
  keeping the first settings content from colliding with navigation.

## August 4, 2026 - New sessions show up when you make them (v0.1.252)

- A newly created session now appears in the list immediately instead of after
  a delay of several seconds. The create call returns the session itself, and
  a session no longer falls out of the list entirely while its agent is still
  starting up.
- The "Creating session…" indicator now stays up until the new session is
  actually on screen, rather than finishing before there is anything to see.
- An OpenCode session that fails on its first turn — a rate-limited or
  overloaded provider, a bad key — now says so in the transcript instead of
  sitting on "Working" forever with nothing in it.

## August 4, 2026 - Thinking at a glance (v0.1.251)

- Thinking controls now show their selected effort level directly beside the
  control name and signal-strength indicator, while hold-and-slide adjustments
  use relative finger movement from the currently selected level.

## August 4, 2026 - Mobile pages find their place (v0.1.250)

- Fork and Continue now share the composer's tactile Thinking control, with a
  colored signal-strength indicator, selection-safe long press, and a cleaner
  icon-free slider popup.
- On mobile, Notifications and Artifacts now open as secondary pages from the
  Pages menu, with an explicit back-to-Live action and no composer or
  swipe-through project navigation competing with their content.

## August 4, 2026 - Thinking at your fingertips (v0.1.249)

- The live-session menu now labels its thinking control simply as "Thinking",
  matching the other session-launch controls.
- The new-session composer now turns its Thinking control into a tactile effort
  slider on long press, with tap-to-pick fallback, live level previews, and
  haptic feedback while scrubbing.

## August 4, 2026 - A hosted welcome that knows you (v0.1.248)

- Embedded LFG surfaces can now receive the signed-in viewer's display identity
  from their host, so omg.dev's mobile Computer greets the person by name while
  keeping LFG session ownership and authorization completely separate.

## August 4, 2026 - Questions stay in the conversation (v0.1.247)

- Questions that need your input now appear inside the session that asked them,
  with suggested answers and a freeform reply box available right where the
  conversation is already open.
- Thinking-level menus now use the simpler visible label "Thinking" across new
  sessions, forks, and agent workflows while keeping every level selectable.

## August 4, 2026 - Image quality stays visible (v0.1.246)

- Every image attachment now shows its HD quality control immediately. Large
  images keep the compressed/original toggle, while images already being sent
  at full resolution show HD selected instead of hiding the control.

## August 4, 2026 - Recovery needs one tap (v0.1.245)

- Sessions recovered after a host restart now offer a one-tap Continue action,
  and paused sessions use a clear pause icon in place of the normal green idle
  dot without relying on emoji labels.

## August 4, 2026 - Thinking controls tuck in (v0.1.244)

- The live thinking-level selector now lives inside the existing session menu
  on desktop and mobile, keeping session headers focused while still showing
  the current level at a glance in the menu.

## August 4, 2026 - Thinking controls, in the moment (v0.1.243)

- Live session headers now show the active thinking level and let you change it
  for subsequent turns without starting over; each agent offers only the levels
  its current runtime supports.

## August 4, 2026 - Mobile controls return (v0.1.242)

- The standalone mobile Live header once again shows its top-right account and
  pages island alongside the personal welcome. Hosted omg.dev surfaces still
  leave that corner to the host's own controls.

## August 4, 2026 - The first message is yours again (v0.1.241)

- LFG's launch instructions are shorter while preserving the narration,
  verification, shipping, landing, and session-safety rules agents need.
- The runtime contract now appears as its own collapsed instructions block in
  the transcript, so the user's actual first message is immediately readable;
  existing session history benefits without being rewritten.

## August 4, 2026 - One reconnect, one message (v0.1.240)

- Embedded Computer surfaces now share the same reconnect notification from
  interruption through recovery, so returning to Home or Settings cannot show
  "Reconnected" twice for one physical connection.
- Cloud Computers now archive the minimum number of oldest idle, durable agents
  needed to admit new work safely; their transcripts remain available from
  Resume, and the new session appears immediately instead of failing on memory.
- Plan concurrency is authoritative throughout LFG: Free allows 1 active agent,
  Personal 5, Pro 16, and Always-on 24, including the Settings and Performance
  surfaces users see.

## August 3, 2026 - The welcome comes home to omg (v0.1.239)

- omg.dev's mobile Computer now shows the same personal Live welcome, active
  agent count, and agent-question handoff as standalone LFG instead of falling
  back to a static logo.
- The shared header automatically leaves room for omg.dev's account and plan
  controls, so hosted and standalone surfaces keep one behavior without
  overlapping their independently owned chrome.

## August 3, 2026 - Continued sessions keep their names (v0.1.238)

- Continuing a session into a replacement now carries over the source session's
  displayed name, including names you set yourself, instead of naming the new
  session from its internal handoff prompt. Ordinary forks still get their own
  independent name.

## August 3, 2026 - Agents stop before the Computer does (v0.1.237)

- Cloud Computers now reserve memory before starting an agent and keep enough
  headroom for LFG, the operating system, and the secure tunnel to stay alive.
- Simultaneous starts share one atomic memory budget, so a launch burst cannot
  race the machine into an out-of-memory crash. When memory is tight, LFG asks
  the user to finish an agent or upgrade instead of starting work that will die.

## August 3, 2026 - Photos upload small by default (v0.1.236)

- Images attached to any composer are now downscaled and re-encoded in the
  browser before they upload: a 1.6 MB phone photo goes up as a 96 KB WebP, so
  attachments land in a fraction of the time on a phone connection.
- Tap **HD** on an attachment chip to send the untouched original instead, and
  tap it again to go back to the compressed copy. Sending while an image is
  still compressing waits for the small copy rather than racing it.
- Annotated screenshots are compressed on the same terms, images already small
  enough are left alone, and GIFs keep their animation.
- Re-encoding also drops camera EXIF, so a photo's GPS coordinates no longer
  ride along with the upload.

## August 3, 2026 - Listing sessions gets out of everything else's way (v0.1.235)

- Binding a newly started Codex session to its transcript used to search every
  Codex session ever recorded on the box — 3,604 of them here, re-checked every
  couple of seconds. It now looks only at the last week, which is all a
  just-started session can be, and the session list rebuilds around a quarter
  faster.
- The last piece of the rebuild that stopped the server outright — asking tmux
  for its panes — no longer does. The worst pause the rebuild inflicts on
  everything else is down to about 10ms.
- Both changes were checked against the real fleet: the session list they
  produce is identical, down to every Codex binding and tmux pane.

## August 3, 2026 - The right agent from the first frame (v0.1.234)

- Managed Computers now keep the saved OpenCode choice visible while their
  live agent roster loads, instead of briefly presenting Claude during boot.

## August 3, 2026 - More room for parallel work (v0.1.233)

- Cloud Computers now admit up to 1 simultaneous agent on Free, 5 on Personal,
  16 on Pro, and 24 on Always On, with atomic reservations preventing a burst
  of launches from exceeding the plan's limit.

## August 3, 2026 - Forking stays put (v0.1.232)

- Fork and Continue now open in a stable modal on phones instead of a draggable
  drawer, so typing, textarea scrolling, and the software keyboard no longer
  compete with the sheet gesture. Compact keyboard layouts keep every action
  reachable through the modal's own scroll area.

## August 3, 2026 - Your Computer, ready first (v0.1.231)

- Managed hosts can now open a credential-free Computer directly and keep
  Claude, Codex, and other provider connections as optional Settings actions.
- Ordinary embedded LFG installs retain the existing first-run connection
  guide unless their host explicitly takes ownership of onboarding.

## August 3, 2026 - A focused first choice (v0.1.230)

- Grok is temporarily hidden from the first-run Computer connection choices.
  Its existing login and runtime support remain intact for a future return.

## August 3, 2026 - Every link opens in the right folder (v0.1.229)

- Tapping an Ask question now opens the conversation that asked it, while an
  explicit More action expands the full question and reply composer in place.
- Opening a session from Notifications or Artifacts now selects that session's
  folder automatically, so the destination is visible in the correct scope.

## August 3, 2026 - Your Computer meets your tools (v0.1.228)

- The first-run Computer connection flow now has two focused steps: connect a
  coding agent, then connect the tools that agent works through.
- Grok joins Claude Code and Codex as a browser-login option, using its existing
  device-code flow with no terminal handoff.
- GitHub can now be connected from onboarding for private repositories, pushes,
  and pull requests. The same device-login session owner handles agent and tool
  authentication, including expiry and cancellation.

## August 3, 2026 - Toasts land on the right edge (v0.1.227)

- Desktop toasts now sit at the bottom of the screen, while mobile toasts stay
  below the top chrome and fold their stacked layers back toward the top edge.

## August 3, 2026 - Computer plans guard their real capacity (v0.1.226)

- Cloud Computers now enforce their plan's agent concurrency at LFG's single
  session-admission boundary: Free/Trial 1, Personal 2, Pro 4, Always On 8.
- Concurrent launch races reserve a slot before any asynchronous work, so a
  burst of requests cannot overfill the machine while sessions are registering.
- A live plan change is read from the control-plane-owned plan file on every
  admission, so downgrades lower the cap immediately without restarting LFG.

## August 3, 2026 - A welcome that knows when to speak (v0.1.225)

- The mobile Live welcome now gets a full eight seconds before briefly yielding
  to agent activity, and activity appears only while an agent is actually
  working — idle rooms stay on the welcome instead of cycling filler.
- The welcome is larger, while agent questions use the same clean plain-text
  treatment instead of switching the header into a bell-and-count badge.

## August 3, 2026 - A clean way out (v0.1.224)

- `lfg uninstall` now removes the LFG service, command, MCP registrations, and
  release application files while preserving sessions and config for a future
  reinstall.
- `lfg uninstall --purge --yes` is the explicit destructive path for deleting
  sessions and config too. Shared tools such as Bun, Tailscale, tmux, and agent
  CLIs are never removed, and source checkouts stay intact by default.

## August 3, 2026 - Mobile Live is a list again (v0.1.223)

- Live view on mobile no longer expands a session in place. Every session is a
  compact row — title, latest activity, status — and tapping it opens the full
  session sheet, which stays the one place to read and reply.
- The long-press-to-expand gesture is gone, along with the transcript streams
  those expanded cards kept open in the background. Desktop is unchanged.

## August 3, 2026 - A welcome with a pulse (v0.1.222)

- The mobile Live header now cycles between the personal welcome and current
  agent activity. Status appears as a smaller shimmering line, while the soft
  text swap respects reduced-motion preferences and urgent questions still
  take priority.

## August 3, 2026 - Toasts follow their edge (v0.1.221)

- Top-anchored toasts now dismiss upward through the top edge, including
  background toasts in a collapsed stack, instead of slipping downward.

## August 3, 2026 - A welcome that reflects the room (v0.1.220)

- The mobile Live welcome now keeps its compact, bell-free single line while
  showing current activity inline, using larger type, and sitting closer to the
  screen edge. When no agents are working, it switches to “Ready to build.”

## August 3, 2026 - Every artifact leads home (v0.1.219)

- Artifact cards now show the conversation that created them. Open the related
  session straight from the gallery, including finished sessions that need to
  be reviewed or resumed.

## August 3, 2026 - A quieter mobile hello (v0.1.218)

- The mobile Live welcome is now one compact line with no bell icon or
  secondary status copy. Bells, context, and the wider card remain reserved
  for agent questions that actually need attention.

## August 3, 2026 - A lighter mobile welcome (v0.1.217)

- The mobile Live welcome now sits directly on the page instead of inside a
  frosted card. The introductory LFG mark and urgent agent-question states
  still keep their pill treatment so notifications remain easy to spot and tap.

## August 3, 2026 - A Live header that knows what is happening (v0.1.216)

- On mobile, the Live header now introduces the LFG mark for two seconds and
  then turns that same island into a personal welcome using the active profile.
- The welcome stays useful after hello: it shows how many agents are building,
  changes into an urgent notification when an agent needs input, and opens the
  unified Notification Center when tapped.
- Toasts now arrive at the top center, immediately below the mobile header,
  instead of competing with the persistent composer at the bottom of the screen.

## August 3, 2026 - Faster, complete mic messages (v0.1.215)

- Releasing the mic no longer discards the realtime transcription's final
  update and then waits 1.8 seconds before sending a possibly cut-off partial.
  LFG keeps that final update connected and sends as soon as it arrives.
- Each voice take now has one explicit commit boundary. Realtime partial text
  still appears while speaking, while duplicate close-time commits are removed
  and whole-clip transcription remains a fallback only when realtime fails.

## August 3, 2026 - Pinned means protected (v0.1.214)

- Smart clear now leaves pinned sessions running while it archives the other
  idle sessions in scope. Its confirmation also calls out how many pinned
  sessions are being protected.
## August 3, 2026 - The last freeze, at startup (v0.1.213)

- Restarting LFG used to stall it for several seconds about a minute in, while
  it re-read the header of every Codex session ever recorded on the box — 3,517
  files and 1.8GB here. Those headers never change, so they are kept now: the
  first session list after a restart went from 3.9s to 0.25s.
- With that gone, yesterday's other fixes hold up on a full day of real
  traffic: requests to the session list that took over a second dropped from
  686 to effectively zero, and the ones that remained were all this startup
  stall, which is now fixed too.

## August 3, 2026 - Quieter interrupted turns (v0.1.212)

- Steering an agent mid-task no longer leaves a large synthetic
  `[Request interrupted by user for tool use]` chat bubble behind. The event
  now appears as a subtle `Interrupted` status between the surrounding turns.

## August 2, 2026 - Fewer whole-server freezes (v0.1.211)

- Listing sessions ran `pgrep` twice, forking a process to ask the operating
  system something it already publishes as files. LFG reads that directly now,
  which is about ten times faster and, more importantly, doesn't block the
  server while it happens. Today's log recorded 686 requests that took over a
  second and 220 over five — during which nothing else moved, including live
  streams and reconnects.

## August 2, 2026 - Reconnecting is quick again (v0.1.210)

- Coming back to a tab that had gone stale — after sleep, or a long spell in
  the background — made LFG wait a flat 2 seconds before it even started
  reconnecting. It now gives the old connection half a second, which is already
  generous against a server that answers in single-digit milliseconds.
- Waking up or regaining the network now restarts the retry schedule. The first
  attempt after a laptop wake usually fails because Wi-Fi hasn't come back yet,
  and the next retry was using the delay it had wound up to before sleeping —
  up to 12 seconds of sitting on "offline" over a perfectly good network.
- Reconnecting no longer rebuilds transcript history the server then throws
  away, and a tab that reconnects while another one is open now gets the
  current session list immediately instead of waiting for something to change.
- The shipped feed, artifact gallery, coding-agents page, resume sheet and
  token-usage dialog now load only when opened, taking another 39 KB out of the
  bundle you download before anything renders.

## August 2, 2026 - The app paints a third faster on a cold load (v0.1.209)

- The AI SDK that powers the chat surface was in the bundle you download before
  anything can render, even though nothing needs it until you open a session.
  It now loads in the background just after first paint, and is already cached
  by the time you open one.
- On a cold 4G load: first contentful paint 1.40s → 0.93s, DOM content loaded
  2.91s → 2.32s, and the entry bundle is 150 KB smaller.

## August 2, 2026 - The server stops re-reading itself every 2.5 seconds (v0.1.208)

- Whenever a browser is open, LFG rebuilds its session list every 2.5 seconds to
  keep the fleet status live — and that rebuild was re-reading and re-parsing
  the entire session registry about eight times over, roughly 700 file reads per
  rebuild. The server was spending around a tenth of its time in a blocking
  rebuild, permanently, which made everything else feel intermittently sticky.
- Entries are now cached and checked against the file's timestamp instead of
  being re-read, so an unchanged session costs a stat rather than a read and a
  parse. Rebuild time drops from 196ms to 45ms, and the worst pause it inflicts
  on everything else from 176ms to 58ms.
- Nothing about liveness changes: a session updated by another process is still
  picked up on the very next poll.

## August 2, 2026 - Returning home no longer repeats replies (v0.1.207)

- Opening Settings and returning Home could briefly render the same assistant
  reply and Thought block several times. The saved transcript was correct, but
  two live listeners could both accept the first event from a locally sent
  message and cache the duplicate UI state. Locally started chats now claim
  their live stream synchronously, while replies started from another device
  still appear normally.
- Starting a new session no longer pauses every other live session while LFG
  runs the Git commands that prepare its worktree. Provisioning now stays off
  the server event loop, and its remote refresh benefits the next session
  without blocking the one you just started.
- Leaving an embedded settings page no longer strips the styling from another
  surface the host still has mounted. Every packaged style is anchored to one
  attribute on the document, and the first surface to unmount removed it —
  so in a host with two surfaces alive, the visible one could drop to unstyled
  markup. The attribute is reference counted now.

## August 2, 2026 - Artifact cards follow your theme instead of your desktop (v0.1.206)

- An artifact rendered in a dark card on a light machine kept its light
  styling — dark surfaces with dark text — because it had no way to see which
  theme the card was in. The renderer now stamps `data-theme` on the artifact
  document (and on the shadow host, where theme selectors were already being
  rewritten against an attribute nothing set), so an artifact can key its dark
  styles off the card rather than off the desktop.
- Artifacts that reach for the short token names (`--lfg-artifact-bg`, `-fg`,
  `-muted-fg`) now get the theme instead of silently falling back to their own
  hardcoded colors.
- Fixed the perf report card itself, which had painted every axis label,
  legend, caption and table header with a *surface* color — invisible in both
  light and dark.

## August 2, 2026 - Sessions on a second Claude account get their tools back (v0.1.205)

- Sessions running on any Claude account other than the first started with no
  LFG tools at all — they could not narrate to the thread, ask you a question,
  publish an artifact, or ship. Each extra account has its own Claude config
  directory, but LFG only ever registered its MCP server into the default one,
  so those sessions launched mute while Setup still showed "Claude MCP ·
  registered".
- Setup now registers into every account's config directory, seeds a newly added
  account the moment you create it, and the Claude MCP check only turns green
  when all of them are covered.
- Embedded apps with two surfaces mounted at once (omg's Computer view behind
  Settings) no longer lose all their styling when you close one of them.

## August 2, 2026 - Text-to-speech removed (v0.1.204)

- Spoken replies are gone: audio mode, the floating audio player, the "speak
  this session" action hidden behind the agent avatar, and the text-to-speech
  provider setting have all been removed.
- "Audio mode · auto-play replies" had been silently broken for some time. The
  hook that fed replies to speech only existed on the older streaming transport,
  so on the default one nothing was ever spoken — while the session was still
  told to keep its answers short and speakable. Turning it on made replies worse
  and produced no audio. (The v0.1.201 note that audio mode "works exactly as
  before" was written before this was discovered.)
- Dictation is untouched: the mic button, voice messages, and the speech-to-text
  provider setting all work exactly as before. The Voice settings section now
  covers just voice input.
- Note for self-hosters: `TTS_UPSTREAM`, `TTS_TOKEN`, and the ElevenLabs/OpenAI
  TTS overrides are no longer read and can be removed from `.env`. The GPU TTS
  engines, the TTS failover timer, and the Modal voice app went with them; the
  Sakana egress proxy in `deploy/modal` stays.

## August 2, 2026 - Embedded chrome survives a settings visit (v0.1.203)

- A host that mounts both surfaces no longer has its full app corrupted by
  opening a settings page. "Renders inside the host's chrome" was a single
  process-wide flag, so a settings page set it once and every later full-app
  render lost its header, gutter and header inset until a hard reload. Each
  mounted tree declares its own now.

## August 2, 2026 - Faster session create and fork (v0.1.202)

- Starting a session no longer waits on a fetch from GitHub. Provisioning its
  worktree refreshed `origin/main` every single time — a network round trip on
  the critical path that also froze the server for its duration, so every other
  session's live updates stalled with it. It now refreshes at most once a minute
  per repository, and gives up rather than hanging if the remote is slow.
- Forking a session no longer rebuilds the whole session list just to look up
  the session you are forking from.
- Together: creating a session is about 37% faster and forking about 48% faster
  on the server side, and neither one stalls the sessions you already have open.
- Settings > Computer no longer renders with a missing header and collapsed
  gutter after you visit Settings. Two surfaces can now be open at once without
  one describing the other.
## August 2, 2026 - Phone call and voice orb removed (v0.1.201)

- The LiveKit phone-call screen and the voice orb are gone. The call UI had
  already been unreachable — nothing could open it — while still shipping about
  8 MB of 3D and realtime-audio libraries to every visitor. Audio mode, which
  speaks the current session, already covers what the call was for.
- The web bundle is roughly 8 MB smaller as a result.
- Dictation, spoken replies, audio mode, the voice provider settings, and the
  deep-think advisor behind "ask a question" all work exactly as before.
- Setting a voice API key now tells you which half you just enabled ("Voice
  messages are ready" / "Spoken replies are ready") instead of claiming all of
  voice is ready when only one provider was configured.
- Note for self-hosters: the GPU voice stacks under `deploy/` were only ever
  reachable through the call path, so `TTS_UPSTREAM` / `STT_UPSTREAM` are no
  longer read. Their READMEs now say so, and the TTS failover timer no longer
  affects anything.

## August 2, 2026 - Mounted settings pages sit in the host's column (v0.1.200)

- A settings page mounted inside another product now fills that product's
  column instead of centring a narrower one inside it. Every card previously
  sat inset from the host's own cards, and the mount read as a panel dropped
  into the page rather than part of it.

## August 2, 2026 - One number per account on the campfire (v0.1.199)

- A Claude account on the campfire no longer shows its number twice. The label
  under the icon already reads "Claude 1", so the numbered badge stamped on the
  icon was a duplicate; renamed accounts keep the badge, since their label
  doesn't say which login it is.
- The chat composer's one-line controls are centered.

## August 2, 2026 - Session creation feedback stays in its lane (v0.1.198)

- The shimmering session-creation state now covers only the rounded input card,
  leaving project, attachment, and action controls visible while LFG starts the
  session.

## August 2, 2026 - Every Claude account's usage, and a chip you can see (v0.1.197)

- A Claude account whose access token had gone stale now reports its usage
  again. Claude Code refreshes that token whenever it runs; LFG read the same
  file without running the CLI, so an account that hadn't started a session in
  the last few hours looked like it had no usage at all. LFG now refreshes the
  token itself before asking.
- The selected agent chip in the composer is actually visible in dark mode. It
  was a #2c2c2e circle on a #1c1c1e sheet — sixteen levels of grey apart, which
  on a phone reads as nothing being selected at all.

## August 2, 2026 - Reconnects stop waiting on settings (v0.1.196)

- Reopening LFG no longer freezes every request while it boots five agent CLIs
  to inspect MCP setup. Those checks now run only on the Coding agents page,
  run together without blocking live sockets or the API, and finish roughly
  three times faster when that page is opened.
- The startup payload no longer carries the entire skill catalog before the
  user asks for a skill. On this instance that removes about 106 KB over the
  wire on every cold load; slash-skill suggestions still fetch it on demand.
- The changelog moved out of the startup JavaScript and into its own on-demand
  chunk, trimming another 32 KB of Brotli-compressed code from the cold path.

## August 2, 2026 - Session creation no longer looks stuck (v0.1.195)

- Starting a session now replaces the composer with a clear, shimmering
  "Creating session…" status while LFG prepares the worktree and starts the
  agent. The mobile composer and desktop new-session drawer both stay visibly
  busy instead of clearing or disappearing with no feedback.
- The creating state blocks accidental duplicate launches. If startup fails,
  the overlay clears and the original prompt returns so it can be retried.

## August 2, 2026 - The mic responds on the first tap (v0.1.194)

- Tapping the mic now opens it immediately. Every tap used to wait on a network
  round trip before the microphone was even requested, so on a slow connection
  the browser's permission prompt could appear ten seconds late — and on iOS and
  installed PWAs that wait often broke the request outright, which is why so
  many taps did nothing at all.
- The mic button shows a spinner the moment you tap it, so it can never look
  dead while the mic is opening. Tapping again backs out instead of doing
  nothing, and Escape, the cancel X, and slide-to-cancel all work during that
  window too.
- A mic that can't start now says why — blocked permission, no microphone
  found, or the device being held by another app — instead of failing silently.
- Opening the mic can no longer hang indefinitely, and cancelling takes effect
  the instant you tap rather than after the timeout.
- Dictation no longer leaves the microphone held open (OS mic indicator lit)
  when a take is abandoned partway through.
- Dictation now asks for echo cancellation, noise suppression, and automatic
  gain control, matching what voice calls already did.

## August 2, 2026 - Claude accounts you can actually see (v0.1.193)

- Picking "Claude · Auto" in the agent picker now highlights it. The Auto entry
  was the one option that never lit up, so the composer looked like nothing was
  selected — and swiping to cycle agents or tapping to collapse the row didn't
  work from Auto either.
- The campfire no longer hides a Claude account it couldn't read. An account
  whose usage lookup fails — expired sign-in, rate limit — keeps its place on
  the arc, dimmed, with the reason underneath, instead of silently disappearing
  and leaving you to wonder where the account went.
- The composer's agent icon is centered when the composer is a single line.

## August 2, 2026 - A roomier "new version" prompt (v0.1.192)

- The post-deploy "New version available" screen no longer borrows the crash
  layout. It gets a centered icon, a title you can read, a line explaining that
  the app updated while your tab was open, and a full-width Reload button — no
  longer a tiny cluster of controls stranded on an empty black screen.

## August 2, 2026 - Sent images are their own view (v0.1.191)

- An attached image is no longer boxed inside the message bubble. The picture
  gets its own frame and the words keep theirs, stacked — the way every
  messaging client does it. Sharing a screenshot with a caption no longer reads
  as one cramped card.
- Attach an image and type nothing and the picture is the whole message, with
  no empty bubble under it. A lone image renders larger; several tile.
- Attachments with nothing to show inline (a PDF, or an image whose bytes are
  gone) now read as a proper file card rather than a tag inside a bubble.

## August 2, 2026 - Attached images show up as images (v0.1.190)

- Screenshots you attach now render as thumbnails inside your own message
  instead of a wall of `/tmp/lfg-uploads/...` paths. Sending six images used to
  fill the transcript with six file paths and nothing you could actually look
  at. Tap one to open the full-size viewer.
- A lone image widens to the bubble; several tile side by side. Attachments
  with nothing to show inline — a PDF, or an image whose bytes were cleared
  when the box rebooted — appear as a named file chip rather than a broken
  image.
- What the agent receives is unchanged: the absolute paths still travel with
  the message, so a coding agent can read the files exactly as before. Only the
  rendering changed.

## August 2, 2026 - Host-mounted settings behave like pages (v0.1.189)

- A product embedding LFG's settings pages no longer has them replaced by the
  "Connect a coding agent" prompt. That gate exists for a framed full app,
  which cannot run a session without an agent; a host that mounted a single
  settings page was shown onboarding where its settings should have been, with
  no way to reach the page at all.
- Embedded settings pages can now be routed by the host. `LfgSettingsSurface`
  reports its own navigation through `onNavigate` and accepts `page` as a
  controlled prop, so Coding agents, Schedules, Storage and More become real
  destinations in the host's URL — linkable, and with a back button that goes
  up one page instead of leaving the surface.
- A host-mounted page now shows its own shape while the machine is still
  answering, instead of painting an empty ping, "0 working" and "—" storage as
  if they were facts about the box.

## August 2, 2026 - SDK sessions survive restarts (v0.1.188)

- AI-SDK, Codex SDK, OpenCode, and Pi sessions now run as direct managed
  processes instead of using tmux as an otherwise-unused lifecycle wrapper.
  LFG journals their boot ownership, adopts them across service restarts, and
  safely reopens interrupted conversations after a host reboot without
  replaying an unfinished prompt.
- Resuming a conversation now keeps its provider/model identity together,
  repairs stale cross-provider cache rows, and ignores dead managed entries so
  a stopped harness cannot masquerade as an already-live session.

## August 2, 2026 - Claude capacity routes itself (v0.1.187)

- New and forked Claude sessions now default to `Claude · Auto`, choosing the
  connected account with the most room in its tightest usage window and pinning
  that concrete account for the session's lifetime. Explicit numbered-account
  choices remain available, while unknown capacity stays a fallback ahead of an
  account known to be exhausted.

## August 1, 2026 - Embedded terminals use their host transport (v0.1.186)

- Terminals mounted inside another product now open their WebSocket through
  the same authenticated host transport as HTTP and live transcript traffic.
  They previously inferred the socket from the embedding page URL, so OMG
  cloud Computers tried to connect to the dashboard itself and immediately
  closed instead of reaching the Computer's LFG runtime.

## August 1, 2026 - Archive wording everywhere (v0.1.185)

- Session swipe actions, keyboard confirmations, and Smart clear now consistently
  say Archive instead of Delete or End. Confirmations also make clear that an
  archived session leaves the live view but remains available to resume later
  from Recent sessions.

## August 1, 2026 - Cloud workspaces can update themselves again (v0.1.184)

- LFG running in an OMG cloud workspace can now take updates. It restarts
  itself there by exiting into the loop OMG keeps it alive with, but it was
  looking for that loop at a path OMG no longer uses, so it concluded no
  restart was possible and turned down every update before downloading it —
  leaving each workspace pinned to whatever version it was created with. The
  four free-tier workspaces we checked were sixteen releases behind, which
  means none of the recent memory and reliability work had ever reached them.
  Update now works from the Settings page as it does everywhere else.

## August 1, 2026 - One MCP server for the whole box (v0.1.183)

- Running several Claude sessions at once no longer costs a duplicate
  background process each. LFG registered itself with Claude as a stdio MCP
  server, so every session started its own copy of `lfg mcp` — around 38 MB
  apiece, and a box with 14 sessions was carrying 14 identical ones (~540 MB)
  whose only job was to forward calls to the LFG server already running beside
  them. The server now answers MCP directly at `/mcp`, and Claude is pointed
  there over HTTP, so sessions share one endpoint. Existing installs migrate
  the next time MCP setup runs; Codex, OpenCode, Grok and Cursor keep working
  exactly as before.

## August 1, 2026 - Security patches for the graph we actually ship (v0.1.182)

- Patched the vulnerable transitive dependencies in the bundle: `fast-uri`,
  `hono`, `body-parser`, `protobufjs`, `brace-expansion`, and `@hono/node-server`
  (unblocked by moving `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to 1.30.x, which widens its
  own range rather than forcing a major on a package that never agreed to one).
- Removed three stale `package-lock.json` files. Nothing installed from them —
  every path here uses bun — but `npm ci` would have quietly built a mid-July
  dependency graph, and they were the only thing Dependabot could see, so its 20
  alerts described a tree nobody ships.
- Added a `bun audit` workflow on push, PR, and a weekly schedule, so the real
  lockfile is watched and new high-severity advisories fail the build. Accepted
  exceptions are explicit and the full report is always printed.

## August 1, 2026 - Mounted settings sit flush with their host (v0.1.181)

- A settings page mounted in another product no longer carries LFG's own page
  layout with it. It was still applying a side gutter, a top inset reserving
  space for the header bare mode had already removed, and an absolutely
  positioned scroll box — all of which exist to accommodate LFG's chrome. The
  visible result was cards sitting inset from the host's own cards on the same
  page, with a gap above them.


## August 1, 2026 - One tick in the project picker (v0.1.180)

- The Projects sheet no longer shows a green tick next to "All projects" and a
  named project at the same time. Each row decided its own tick from a separate
  piece of state, and the composer legitimately holds both — with the live view
  unfiltered it still has to pick a concrete folder for the next session — so
  the single-choice list ended up with two answers. The tick now always follows
  the project your agent will actually work in, and "All projects" claims it
  only when no specific folder is on the hook.

## August 1, 2026 - Terminal keyboard fixes (v0.1.179)

- The pulled-up session terminal no longer jumps around when the on-screen
  keyboard opens. It was sized against the full screen height, which iOS does
  not shrink for the keyboard — it shrinks the visible area and scrolls the page
  instead — so the sheet got shoved under the keyboard and dragged along by that
  scroll. It now sits in the real visible area, and takes the whole of it while
  you're typing so you get more terminal rather than a squeezed one.
- The terminal stops flickering during that keyboard animation. It was
  re-fitting the grid and repainting the pane on every viewport sample, most of
  which report the same size; identical sizes are now ignored.
- The mobile new-session composer no longer rides the keyboard up and down
  behind the terminal sheet — it's hidden while a terminal is up, the same way
  it already hides behind the artifact viewer.
- Typing in the terminal no longer auto-capitalises. Mobile keyboards treated
  Ghostty's input as prose and sentence-cased it, turning `git status` into
  `Git status`. Autocorrect, predictions and spellcheck are off too: it types
  lowercase and Shift means Shift.

## August 1, 2026 - Per-session terminals and a vi key menu (v0.1.178)

- Every session now has its own terminal. Press `t` on the focused session (or
  pick Terminal from its ⋮ menu) to pull up a real shell already sitting in that
  session's worktree — no `cd`, no hunting for the path. It's a persistent tmux
  session per agent session, so it survives deploys and reconnects with your
  scrollback and any long-running command intact.
- The terminal is full-bleed now. The permanent on-screen key toolbar (about
  110px of chrome that sat there whether or not you needed it) is gone; all that
  remains is one slim status strip.
- The extra keys moved into a vi-style menu you summon with ⌃⇧K, the Keys
  button, or a swipe up from the bottom edge. It's modal like vi: `h j k l` for
  arrows, `e` Esc, `t` Tab, `r` ⏎, `c` ^C, `d` ^D, `p`/`n` for history, `0`/`$`
  for line ends, `g`/`G`, `u`/`f` to page, `i` to hand focus back to the shell,
  `P` to paste, `.` to repeat the last key, `:` to type any key spec (`ctrl+p`,
  `f5`, `alt+.`), `s` to stick the menu open, `q` to close. Every key is also a
  tap target with its hint shown, so phones just tap.

## August 1, 2026 - A much smaller server (v0.1.177)

- The server now starts about 130 MB lighter. Image encoding (sharp) and the
  browser engine (playwright) used to be loaded the moment the server booted,
  even though most servers never encode an image or drive a browser. They are
  loaded the first time they are actually needed instead, which takes a fresh
  server from roughly 306 MB to 176 MB of memory.
- Small machines benefit most. On a 512 MiB free-plan Cloud Computer the old
  footprint left too little room to run a coding agent beside LFG, and agents
  could be killed by the guest shortly after launch. There is now room for both.
- Nothing about image previews, shipped-post media or saved browser logins
  changes — the first use of each pays the load once and then reuses it.

## August 1, 2026 - Voice composers that stay in place (v0.1.176)

- The home and live-session chat composers now share the same growing textarea
  and maximum height. Long prompts scroll inside the field instead of expanding
  the whole home composer, so the agent and microphone controls stay anchored.
- Live voice transcription now follows the newest spoken line in both
  composers. Manual edits in the middle of a long draft keep their position and
  are not pulled back to the bottom.

## August 1, 2026 - Settings that a host can mount (v0.1.175)

- Hosts embedding LFG can mount a settings page on its own now, and it renders
  as sections only — no LFG header, brand mark, identity block or bottom nav.
  Mounted inside a product that already has its own header and account, the
  surface used to draw a second one of each, which is the duplication that
  mounting a shared surface is meant to remove in the first place.
- `?bare=1` renders that same hosted layout in a plain browser, so it can be
  checked without building the package and mounting it in a host.


## August 1, 2026 - Faster, steadier image previews (v0.1.174)

- Image messages now carry their orientation-correct width and height from the
  display tool through storage and the transcript API. Image cards reserve that
  exact aspect ratio while loading instead of jumping from a generic placeholder
  to the finished preview.
- Transcript images load a lighter WebP capped to 1080px on both axes, so tall
  screenshots no longer download thousands of invisible pixels. Opening an
  image still fetches the untouched original at full resolution.

## August 1, 2026 - Smoother sessions and agent setup (v0.1.173)

- Installed PWAs now notify you when a coding session finishes a turn, with the
  session's latest response and a direct link back to it. Notifications stay
  quiet while that session is already open on screen.
- Grok and Pi now show only the thinking levels their own CLIs accept. Stored
  higher levels are safely clamped instead of killing a Grok launch or being
  silently ignored by Pi, and Pi gains its native Off and Minimal choices.
- The skills catalog now includes installed plugin commands, including nested
  commands, so command-only plugins are discoverable in the same place as
  skills.
- Tall desktop dialogs keep their footers and action buttons inside the popup;
  long folder lists remain scrollable instead of pushing their buttons out of
  reach.
- Session landing and credential tests are now portable and safe on macOS:
  landing uses the platform's available file locker, and tests never read or
  print a developer's real Claude Keychain token.

## August 1, 2026 - Settings, regrouped (v0.1.172)

- Settings is a one-pager now. It used to be seventeen sections in a single
  scroll that mixed your account, this machine and this browser with no
  ordering, so finding anything meant reading all of it. It now goes account,
  connection, **Computer** (Coding agents · Schedules · Storage & performance),
  agent capacity, updates, More.
- **Storage & performance** is a new page. Disk capacity was already being
  reported, but only as a fourth gauge row buried in settings; it is now a
  headline read — how much of the disk is gone, how much is left — above CPU,
  agent-slice and host memory. Four live gauges no longer greet you on the
  settings root.
- **More** holds the long tail: provider limits, terminal, browser profiles,
  voice, extensions, install, and the browser-local preferences (dark mode,
  push, sound, haptics, audio mode) grouped under "This device" and labelled
  as not synced — because they never were.
- **Auto agents are now Schedules**, with a proper page title, and the timezone
  control moved onto that page. Schedules are the only thing it affects, so it
  had no business sitting on its own in settings.
- Hosts embedding LFG can now mount these settings pages directly via
  `LfgSettingsSurface` from `@lfg-dev/app`, underneath their own account and
  plan UI, instead of reimplementing them and drifting.

## August 1, 2026 - A calmer session rail (v0.1.171)

- The Claude account number now sits bottom-right on every agent icon in the
  app, matching the agent pickers and the usage campfire, so it is always in
  the same place.
- Session avatars no longer carry a green "idle" dot. Idle is the resting state
  of nearly every row, so the dots were a wall of green marking that nothing was
  happening — the rail's groups and counts already show the shape of the fleet.
  Only a session that is working right now gets a mark, and it moved to the
  top-right corner so it never competes with the account number.

## August 1, 2026 - Claude account numbers on every session (v0.1.170)

- A session pinned to a numbered Claude account now wears that number on its
  agent mark everywhere the mark appears: the rail rows, the session card and
  detail headers (the top-left icon), and the session picker. Telling which
  login a session is running on no longer means opening it.
- The number only appears once a second account is connected — with one login
  there is nothing to disambiguate — and sits opposite the busy/idle dot so
  neither signal covers the other.
- Fixed returning to LFG from another app sometimes leaving the UI packed into
  the top slice of the screen with dead space below, until a pinch or rotate
  forced a relayout. A shrunken viewport now only counts as a soft keyboard when
  something is actually focused, and the shell re-samples instead of latching a
  mid-animation reading from iOS.

## August 1, 2026 - Usage follows your Claude accounts (v0.1.169)

- Usage now reports one entry per connected Claude account. The campfire view
  (Shift, or long-press the composer rings) shows a numbered node per account,
  and Settings → Usage lists each account's own 5-hour and 7-day windows instead
  of collapsing every login into a single "Claude" row.
- Picking an account on the campfire arc starts the next session on that
  account, rather than on whichever one the composer was last left on.
- The composer's activity rings show the selected account's limits and re-read
  them when you switch accounts — previously they always showed the first
  account's numbers.
- Each usage source is now fetched independently instead of through one combined
  request. Surfaces that need a single ring make a single request (~135ms rather
  than ~300ms+ on this box), the campfire fills in agent by agent as each source
  answers instead of waiting on the slowest, and one account's refresh no longer
  re-walks the Codex sessions tree or re-hits Grok's billing API.
- A crowded arc now sizes and spaces its nodes to fit, so six or more agents
  (which multiple Claude accounts make routine) no longer overlap on a phone.

## July 31, 2026 - Multiple Claude accounts (v0.1.168)

- Connect multiple Claude subscriptions from Coding agents settings. Each login
  is isolated, numbered, and can be reconnected or removed independently.
- The new-session and fork agent pickers now show one Claude icon per connected
  account, with a small account number at the bottom-right of each icon.
- Claude sessions stay pinned to the account they started with, including after
  a restart or resume, so switching the target for a new session never changes
  the identity of work already in progress.

## July 31, 2026 - Anonymous OpenCode models are truly anonymous (v0.1.167)

- Skipping provider setup now limits OpenCode's picker to discovered
  `opencode/*-free` models. Models from credentialed providers are no longer
  shown merely because the OpenCode CLI knows their names; connecting a
  user-owned model account restores the broader discovered catalog.

## July 31, 2026 - Hosted Computer identity no longer depends on email (v0.1.166)

- An omg hosted Computer with no local user roster no longer rejects session
  creation or resume when the embedded browser remembers an account email.
  Hosted access remains owned by omg's stable account id; LFG's email field is
  treated only as optional presentation metadata.
- The embedded client now sends an owner only when it exists in the Computer's
  current roster. A changed or stale email can no longer strand create, resume,
  continue, fork, finding-reply, or session-management flows.

## July 31, 2026 - OpenCode's safe default everywhere (v0.1.165)

- New and resumed OpenCode sessions now resolve their default from the same
  live catalog shown in the picker. The server can no longer bypass the picker
  and silently launch the removed `opencode-go` provider when no model was
  supplied.

## July 31, 2026 - Hosted model choices that actually run (v0.1.164)

- Skipping account setup in an omg hosted Computer now leaves one honest
  choice: OpenCode. Claude, Codex, and other account-backed agents appear only
  after that user-owned account is connected, rather than being unlocked by
  platform proxy credentials.
- OpenCode's live model list is now authoritative. Removed providers such as
  `opencode-go` can no longer leak back into the picker from an old built-in
  catalog; before discovery completes, LFG offers the verified anonymous
  DeepSeek Flash model as its safe fallback.
## July 31, 2026 - Continue in a clean session (v0.1.163)

- Session menus now have a Continue action beside Fork. It opens a fresh agent
  with the current transcript as context, then archives the session it replaces.
- The replacement is created first, so a launch failure leaves the current
  session live instead of losing the place you were continuing from.

## July 31, 2026 - Resuming a session whose worktree was cleaned up (v0.1.162)

- Resuming certain sessions started and then immediately stopped, with nothing
  in the transcript to explain it. Affected sessions were ones whose per-session
  worktree had since been reclaimed by the automatic cleanup sweep.
- Claude files each conversation under a folder named after the directory the
  session ran in, and finds it again the same way. Once that directory was
  swept, LFG correctly fell back to the repo root — but the conversation was
  still filed under the deleted path, so Claude reported no such conversation
  and quit before the session ever came up.
- LFG now re-files the conversation under the directory it is resuming into, so
  the session comes back with its history intact. Nothing is moved or deleted;
  the original transcript stays where it was.
- If no stored conversation can be found at all, the resume now starts a fresh
  one and says so in the log, instead of failing silently.

## July 31, 2026 - Logo weight matched to the original (v0.1.161)

- The vector wordmark now sits at the same size and weight the mark had before
  it was redrawn. Converting it to vector had also made it noticeably larger and
  heavier than the logo people were used to; it reads as the familiar mark again,
  just sharp.

## July 31, 2026 - A genuinely sharp logo, and updates that actually arrive (v0.1.160)

- The LFG mark is now real vector artwork, so it is sharp at every size. It had
  been a small bitmap dressed up as an SVG since June, which no amount of
  rendering work could rescue at the 24px the header draws it at. Same wordmark,
  same colours — just drawn as outlines instead of pixels.
- Reopening the app now picks up the newest version on its own. An installed app
  is suspended rather than closed, so it could keep running one old build across
  many updates while a "Reload to get the latest" prompt waited in a screen you
  were not looking at. Resuming the app adopts a pending update instead; while
  you are actively using it, LFG still asks first.

## July 31, 2026 - The LFG logo is sharp again (v0.1.159)

- The mark in the top-left header renders crisply on iPhone and iPad again. It
  had looked soft and low-resolution since late June — long enough that it read
  as "the logo is just low-res now" rather than as a bug.
- The artwork was never the problem and has not changed. The header's frosted
  pill carried the blur on the same element that wrapped the logo, and iOS
  folds an SVG into a blurred ancestor's layer and redraws it there, softening
  it. The blur now sits on its own layer behind the pill, so the mark is drawn
  at full resolution. The frosted chrome looks exactly the same.

## July 31, 2026 - Resuming a session no longer replays your old messages (v0.1.158)

- Resuming a session after a crash or restart could re-send your entire message
  history back to the agent as if you had just typed it. The old messages
  arrived stamped with the current time, so they piled up at the bottom of the
  transcript as the "newest" thing, with the real conversation stranded above
  them — and the agent would start answering questions you asked hours ago.
- The cause was a cursor that counted the command log in bytes but compared it
  in characters. Any non-ASCII character — a "—", an "…", an arrow, an emoji,
  the smart punctuation dictated messages are full of — made the two disagree,
  which read as "the file was truncated" and rewound the cursor to the start.
  A single accented character was enough to trigger it.
- On this machine 8 of 33 live sessions were primed to do exactly that, 379
  replayed messages in total, the worst holding 247. All four agent backends
  shared the bug; all four are fixed and covered by tests.
- Sessions now remember how far they got. Messages you send while the server is
  down or restarting are delivered when it comes back, instead of being silently
  dropped — previously the only protection against replay was to skip everything
  that arrived while the session was away.

## July 31, 2026 - Dismiss a question you're not going to answer (v0.1.157)

- "Needs you" questions in the Notification Center can now be dismissed. The
  X on each card was there but invisible — hidden behind a hover state that
  desktop overrode and phones can't trigger at all — so the only way to clear
  a question was to answer it, while it kept the badge lit.
- The dismiss button is always visible now, with a proper tap target, and a
  "Dismiss all" clears a stack of them at once. Bulk dismissal asks for a
  second tap to confirm, since every waiting agent moves on.
- Answering or dismissing a question also takes down its phone notification.
  Those banners are sticky by design, so they used to linger on the lock
  screen long after the question was handled.

## July 31, 2026 - A folder picker you can actually scroll (v0.1.156)

- The Projects sheet shows far more at a glance. The list was boxed into a
  window barely two rows tall; it now opens to roughly eight, so most people
  see every project without scrolling at all.
- Folder paths are hidden by default behind a "Paths" toggle in the sheet
  header. The project name is usually all you need, and dropping the second
  line makes each row about a third shorter. Your choice is remembered.
- Swiping the list scrolls the list. Before, a flick inside that short window
  usually grabbed the sheet instead and dragged it closed.
- With more than seven projects the sheet adds a search box, so a long list is
  a quick type instead of a long scroll.

## July 31, 2026 - Sign in to Grok from the browser (v0.1.155)

- Connecting Grok no longer needs the terminal. Login on the Grok row now opens
  the x.ai approval page directly, shows the one-time code, and detects approval
  on its own — the same flow Claude and Codex already use.
- The approval page opens with the code already filled in, so there is nothing
  to copy across; just check it matches what LFG shows.
- Grok now reports "connected" only when a sign-in token is actually saved.
  Before, it counted the `~/.grok` folder as proof, so it could claim you were
  signed in when you were not.

## July 31, 2026 - One notification inbox (v0.1.154)

- Questions from agents now appear at the top of Notifications and are answered
  right there — tap a suggested option or type a reply. The separate Ask page is
  gone; `/ask` opens Notifications.
- Notifications are far more compact: one row per item with a small media
  thumbnail instead of a full-width gallery, grouped under Today / Yesterday.
  About three times as many fit on a phone screen.
- The "Follow up" button is gone from notification cards. Opening a notification
  takes you to the session, where forking already lives.
- The feed loads faster and lighter: images download at thumbnail size rather
  than full resolution, the list only sends what it shows, and a backgrounded
  tab stops polling.

## July 31, 2026 - Jump to latest stays reachable (v0.1.153)

- The scroll-to-latest pill no longer disappears behind the "files changed /
  Review" bar. When a session has diffs, the pill stacks just above the diff
  bar so you can always jump back to the newest activity.

## July 31, 2026 - Hosted composers send to the selected Computer (v0.1.152)

- Fixes the embedded text composer sending messages to the host dashboard
  instead of the selected LFG Computer. Hosted and custom-connected Computers
  now send through the same authenticated transport as every other session
  action.

## July 31, 2026 - See what each session is using (v0.1.151)

- Restores Token usage to the session menu, opening a focused inspector for
  current context consumption and cumulative model traffic.
- Breaks usage down into input, output, cache, reasoning, tools, skills, system
  prompt, and message categories, while clearly distinguishing provider-reported
  totals from estimated attribution.
- Reads live Codex and Claude session counters when they are available and
  degrades to an explicit unavailable state for agents without token telemetry.

## July 30, 2026 - A real notification center (v0.1.150)

- Rebrands the Shipped page as Notifications, with a canonical
  `/notifications` route while preserving old Shipped links.
- Shipped results now appear as a notification type with per-profile unread
  state. Opening one marks that item read, and Mark all read clears every unread
  marker plus the PWA app-icon badge without deleting notification history.
- Stops silently clearing the PWA badge when the app merely returns to the
  foreground; acknowledgement now happens explicitly inside Notifications.

## July 30, 2026 - Notification dots that know when you are back (v0.1.149)

- The PWA notification dot now clears automatically when LFG opens or returns
  to the foreground, including when a push arrives while the app is already in
  use. Questions, findings, and shipped results remain in their normal in-app
  surfaces until handled.
- Removes the manual notification-dot control from Settings; clearing the OS
  alert is now part of reviewing the app rather than a maintenance task.

## July 30, 2026 - Send and move on (v0.1.148)

- Sending from either mobile composer now dismisses the field focus so the
  on-screen keyboard closes instead of staying in the way.
- Settings now includes a one-tap way to clear the installed PWA's notification
  dot and mark its visible notifications as handled.

## July 30, 2026 - The app appears before it connects (v0.1.147)

- Replaces the full-screen startup spinner with the real LFG interface. While
  bootstrap data is connecting, controls are visibly and semantically disabled;
  they become interactive automatically as soon as the app is ready.

## July 30, 2026 - Shipped notifications open the work (v0.1.146)

- Shipping a result now sends the session owner a push notification with the
  result title and summary. Tapping it opens that exact session for review,
  including when the LFG app is already open.
- Installed PWAs show a badge for visible LFG notifications and clear it once
  the notifications are handled on platforms that support app badging.

## July 30, 2026 - Cleaner navigation islands (v0.1.145)

- Moves Settings into the Pages menu and removes the separate gear from the
  mobile right island and desktop session rail, keeping all page destinations
  in one predictable dropdown without exposing host-owned settings in embeds.

## July 30, 2026 - One project chip on hosted mobile, not two (v0.1.144)

- Removes the project chip from the top-right of the hosted mobile header. The
  composer at the bottom already carries one, both are wired to the same state,
  and on a phone-width header that meant the same folder name printed twice.
  This also brings hosted in line with the plain mobile header, which has never
  shown the chip.
- Keeps "All projects" reachable: it was never part of the mobile swipe cycle,
  so the project menu used to be the only way back to it. The composer's own
  project sheet now offers it, the same row the desktop rail's sheet has.

## July 30, 2026 - Fixes the hosted home-screen crash (v0.1.143)

- Fixes the crash that replaced the whole app with an error screen on the hosted
  surface. The recent-shipped list spread the response of `/api/shipped`
  directly during render, so a proxied workspace answering 2xx without a posts
  array — an error envelope, an empty body, or a wake response while it was
  still asleep — took the entire app down with "Spread syntax requires
  ...iterable not be null or undefined".
- Hardens the Shipped feed and Artifacts gallery against the same class of
  response, so a workspace that answers oddly shows an empty list instead of
  losing the whole page.

## July 30, 2026 - A real crash screen, and crashes that report themselves (v0.1.142)

- Replaces the raw error strip a render crash used to fall through to — a bare
  "Something went wrong!" headline over a red monospace box — with a proper
  screen: what broke, Retry, Reload, a one-tap Copy of the full details, and the
  stack tucked behind a disclosure instead of shouted at you.
- A crash caused by a stale build now says so ("New version available") and
  leads with Reload, because that is the actual fix.
- Render crashes are reported again. The app's own router boundary was catching
  them before any error boundary could, so nothing was recorded — a crash could
  hit a hosted user and leave no trace anywhere. It now files the report itself,
  and only claims "Reported to lfg" when a report really went out.
- Embedded surfaces can be given a central error sink by their host, so a crash
  still gets recorded when the workspace behind the connection is asleep.

## July 30, 2026 - PWA icon cache refresh (v0.1.141)

- Forces one safe service-worker takeover to remove the stale app shell that
  could leave an installed iOS PWA or controlled browser tab rendering the old
  fragmented header icon even after v0.1.138 was deployed.
- Gives the crisp small icon an explicit versioned URL, so Safari, the PWA
  worker, and the HTTP cache cannot reuse older artwork under the same key.
  Later releases return to the normal user-approved update flow.

## July 30, 2026 - Theme-aware artifacts (v0.1.140)

- HTML artifacts can now use LFG's semantic palette for backgrounds, surfaces,
  text, borders, accents, muted content, and code, so the same artifact follows
  the app's light or dark appearance.
- Native Shadow DOM artifacts inherit the live host theme, while interactive
  artifacts receive the same palette inside their isolated sandbox.
- Deliberately authored colors still take precedence, preserving branded and
  self-styled artifacts instead of forcibly recoloring them.

## July 30, 2026 - Quieter error reporting (v0.1.139)

- ResizeObserver delivery notices no longer appear as high-severity findings,
  send push notifications, or claim an auto-fix agent was dispatched. The
  browser and server now share one noise policy, while real observer-related
  application errors remain reportable.
- Session transcript choices now live under the clearer **Display** menu
  without the outdated Experimental badge.

## July 30, 2026 - Crisp LFG mark at small sizes (v0.1.138)

- Keeps the original pixel-dissolve icon while giving 24–40px UI placements
  their own explicit small-size vector. iOS can no longer choose the detailed
  large artwork and shrink its dissolve pixels into unreadable horizontal
  fragments.
- The app header, onboarding, connect gate, and install prompt now use that
  deterministic small mark; large icons and splash artwork stay unchanged.

## July 30, 2026 - Hosts get a slot in the desktop rail (v0.1.137)

- Adds a `rail-footer` host slot at the bottom of the hosted desktop rail. A
  host embedding LFG as its entire desktop surface had nowhere to put its own
  top-level navigation, because that layout suppresses the app header and the
  rail's top row is already full.
- The slot is a real node the host portals into, so it moves with the rail
  instead of floating over it and having to track its width, collapse
  animation and position. It carries the collapsed flag so the host can stack
  vertically in the 56px rail.
- Unfilled slots collapse to nothing, so standalone LFG and hosts that ignore
  the slot are unaffected.

## July 30, 2026 - Hosts can reserve the top-right corner (v0.1.136)

- Adds `--lfg-host-top-inset`, the top-right counterpart to the existing
  `--lfg-host-bottom-inset`. The embedded mobile header now pads its right
  gutter by that amount, so a host floating its own nav island in that corner
  slides our project picker out of the way instead of colliding with it.
- Host-driven rather than hardcoded: it defaults to `0px`, so standalone LFG
  and any host that floats nothing up there reserve nothing, and the host sets
  the real width on its own surface wrapper.

## July 30, 2026 - Original LFG icon restored (v0.1.135)

- Restores the distinctive pixel-dissolve LFG mark across the app, PWA, touch
  icon, and README after the smoother replacement lost too much of its identity.
- Keeps the shared icon generator and asset checks, so the restored artwork
  remains consistent at every required published size.

## July 30, 2026 - Shipped and Artifacts are reachable on desktop (v0.1.134)

- The desktop sidebar gains a pages menu, so Shipped and Artifacts can be opened
  from the rail in both its expanded and collapsed states. Artifacts previously
  had no desktop entry point at all.
- The current page is marked in that menu, and extension tabs appear there too —
  they were previously only reachable through the Settings page.
- Opening Shipped or Artifacts inside a hosted Computer no longer leaves the page
  with no navigation and no way back to Live.
- Fixes hosted sessions briefly showing LFG's own account chrome and profile
  picker after switching pages.

## July 30, 2026 - Crisp LFG icon (v0.1.133)

- The LFG mark now uses smooth vector lettering instead of a coarse pixel grid,
  so it stays clean in the mobile header, onboarding, browser chrome, and larger
  installed-app surfaces.
- PWA, maskable, Apple touch, and README icons are generated from the same
  vector sources to keep every published size consistent.

## July 30, 2026 - Managed transcript recovery (v0.1.132)

- Managed Claude sessions no longer show "session transcript not found" when a
  task mentions flags such as `tsc -p` or `claude --print`.
- Existing affected sessions automatically reconnect to their intact native
  transcript after LFG updates, without losing conversation history.

## July 30, 2026 - Live upload progress restored (v0.1.131)

- File attachments once again show smooth, real byte-by-byte upload percentages
  and progress bars instead of sitting at 0% and jumping to complete.
- Embedded omg.dev uploads keep their authenticated runtime routing while
  reporting progress, including safe token refreshes during an upload.

## July 30, 2026 - Unified mobile session rows (v0.1.130)

- Regular mobile session cards now match the taller Recently shipped row height
  for a more consistent, easier-to-scan feed.
- Recently shipped rows show their source session title instead of repeating
  the project already selected for the page.

## July 30, 2026 - Interactive artifacts run on open (v0.1.129)

- Artifacts that draw themselves with scripts now run immediately in an isolated
  sandbox instead of waiting for an Interactive button, so a live dashboard or
  clickable prototype is interactive the moment you open it.
- Static artifacts keep rendering as real DOM, so they still share the app's
  scroll, text selection and layout, and cost no separate document.
- Gallery tiles stay lightweight previews and mark scripted artifacts with an
  Interactive badge rather than showing a half-drawn chart.
- Fixes a ResizeObserver warning that could surface as an error toast under
  artifact embeds.

## July 30, 2026 - Tighter mobile composer (v0.1.128)

- The mobile new-session composer now sits closer to the feed, removing the
  oversized empty band while preserving side spacing, touch comfort, and the
  device safe area.

## July 30, 2026 - Native artifact rendering (v0.1.127)

- HTML artifacts now render as real DOM in a shadow root instead of a sandboxed
  iframe, so the Shipped feed, the Artifacts gallery, transcript embeds and the
  full-page viewer all share the app's own scroll, text selection and layout.
- Artifact styles stay contained in both directions, and embeds size themselves
  to their real content height — the polling height reporter is gone.
- Artifacts that contain scripts show an Interactive control that runs them in
  an isolated sandbox on request; artifact JavaScript never runs in the app.
- The Shipped feed shows a real preview of each HTML artifact instead of a
  filename row, and pulls far less to paint: image tiles use generated previews
  instead of full-size originals, and videos load when played rather than on
  first paint.
- Feed and gallery refreshes now poll a single page instead of re-downloading
  everything already loaded.

## July 30, 2026 - Inline expired-login recovery (v0.1.126)

- Sessions whose Claude or Codex login expires now show the provider sign-in
  flow directly above the failed turn instead of leaving a dead authentication
  error in the transcript.
- Browser approval, one-time codes, and successful reconnect guidance reuse the
  existing account flow so users can sign back in and retry without leaving the
  session.

## July 30, 2026 - Recently shipped on mobile (v0.1.125)

- Mobile Live now shows the five most recent shipped sessions in a compact
  section below active work, scoped to the selected project.
- Finished sessions open in the normal transcript view, and a View all shortcut
  jumps directly to the complete Shipped feed.

## July 30, 2026 - Dynamic free OpenCode models (v0.1.124)

- OpenCode's live `opencode/*-free` catalog entries now remain available in
  model pickers instead of being dropped by LFG's curated catalog.
- Computers without a connected Claude or Codex account automatically select
  a currently available free OpenCode model; connected accounts keep the
  authenticated default.

## July 30, 2026 - Focused agent updates (v0.1.123)

- Session menus now offer an experimental global **User + LFG output** view
  that keeps user turns and agent-delivered updates readable while hiding
  internal reasoning, routine tool calls, and ordinary assistant chatter.
- Images, videos, and live dashboards remain visible in the focused view, and
  the selection follows the shared LFG settings across sessions and devices.

## July 30, 2026 - Smart mobile bottom fade (v0.1.122)

- The mobile composer wash now disappears at the end of the page and eases back
  in over the preceding 24px, keeping the final session card fully clear.

## July 29, 2026 - Safer session actions (v0.1.121)

- Idle sessions no longer show a Stop action that cannot do anything.
- Ending a live session is now labeled Archive session and confirms with a
  second animated click inside the menu instead of opening a dialog.

## July 29, 2026 - Remembered project folders (v0.1.120)

- Hosted LFG workspaces now reopen on the last selected project instead of
  resetting to All projects and showing sessions from every folder.

## July 29, 2026 - Crisp mobile LFG mark (v0.1.119)

- The self-hosted mobile header now keeps its LFG logo outside the backdrop-blur
  layer, preserving the pixel-art mark's sharp edges on iOS.

## July 29, 2026 - Safer self-hosting and Claude skills (v0.1.118)

- Containerized LFG clients now dial wildcard-bound local servers through the
  correct loopback address, including IPv6-safe URL handling.
- Release self-updates now work with the BSD tar shipped by macOS, and injected
  platform checks correctly recognize the OMG supervisor restart path.
- Skills installed by Claude Code plugins now appear in the skills catalog with
  stable plugin-qualified names.
- Cloud deployment docs now make clear that the shared Dockerfile builds the
  checked-out source directly and does not require a release bundle first.

## July 29, 2026 - Deterministic rename settling (v0.1.117)

- Session renames now remain stable through delayed live-status snapshots,
  even when slow browser networks deliver updates out of order.

## July 29, 2026 - Instant session renaming (v0.1.116)

- Mobile session names now edit directly in the card or session header instead
  of opening a separate drawer.
- Renames appear immediately and stay stable while slow requests, background
  polls, and live status updates finish, without flashing the previous name.

## July 29, 2026 - Balanced mobile fade heights (v0.1.115)

- The mobile composer fade now matches the compact 20px header fade, removing
  the oversized dark wash above the message field.

## July 29, 2026 - Hosted galleries (v0.1.114)

- Hosted LFG surfaces now keep Shipped and Artifacts navigation available on
  mobile and restore shipped shortcuts on desktop.

## July 29, 2026 - Scroll-aware mobile header fade (v0.1.113)

- The mobile header wash now stays transparent at the top of the page so section
  labels remain crisp, then eases in across the first 24px of scrolling.

## July 29, 2026 - Shorter mobile edge fades (v0.1.112)

- Mobile Live content now stays clearer near the floating header and composer,
  with a 20px top wash and the restored 64px bottom fade.

## July 29, 2026 - Balanced mobile chat edges (v0.1.111)

- Mobile Live pages keep their side gutter for card corners and shadows while
  removing the oversized blank bands above the list and behind the composer
  fade.

## July 29, 2026 - Installable release bundles (v0.1.110)

- Hosted Computer template builds can install LFG release bundles again; the
  bundle now carries a runtime-only manifest and matching production lockfile
  instead of referencing source workspaces that are intentionally not shipped.

## July 29, 2026 - Full-width mobile chat (v0.1.109)

- The mobile Live chat page now uses the full available width without an extra
  outer gutter, while gallery-style pages keep their existing spacing.

## July 29, 2026 - Authenticated embedded artifacts (v0.1.108)

- HTML dashboards and videos in hosted Computer sessions now load through the
  authenticated session transport, so transcript cards, the Artifacts gallery,
  Shipped posts, and full-screen viewing render the artifact instead of the
  surrounding Vibes app.

## July 29, 2026 - Embedded artifact images (v0.1.107)

- Artifact images in hosted Computer sessions now load through the authenticated
  session transport, so live transcripts, Shipped posts, zoom, and full-screen
  viewing no longer show broken image placeholders.

## July 29, 2026 - Shipped review in Live (v0.1.106)

- Finished sessions now open inside the normal Live workspace on desktop and in
  the standard session sheet on mobile, while remaining read-only until the
  first message resumes them.

## July 29, 2026 - Review-first shipped sessions (v0.1.105)

- Opening a finished session from Recently Shipped now shows its transcript
  without resuming it; sending a new message resumes the session automatically
  and delivers that message as the first follow-up.

## July 29, 2026 - Unified project picker (v0.1.104)

- The desktop project control now uses the same polished folder pill and icon
  everywhere, while opening the richer project picker with all-projects,
  browse, and new-folder actions.

## July 29, 2026 - Stable session selection and deploy checks (v0.1.103)

- Choosing a different live session after opening a recent Shipped item now
  stays put instead of jumping back during background session refreshes.
- LFG now verifies both the built web assets and the exact entry bundle served
  after restart before reporting a local deployment as successful.

## July 29, 2026 - Project-scoped shipped sessions (v0.1.102)

- Recent Shipped items from project-scoped sessions now open through the normal
  transcript route instead of being misread as folder identifiers.

## July 29, 2026 - Reliable mobile layout and session completion (v0.1.101)

- Mobile lists now reserve the full header, banner, and hosted navigation space,
  keep cards clear of the floating composer, and restore consistent horizontal
  padding so content is no longer clipped or overlapped.
- Agents now explicitly decide whether a Shipped result should close its source
  session, so quick chats and likely follow-ups can stay live.
- Shipped results no longer imply production deployment, and sessions stay open
  when a requested deployment has not been verified.

## July 29, 2026 - Recent shipped sessions (v0.1.100)

- The desktop sidebar now shows the five most recently shipped sessions for
  quick access without leaving the active workspace.
- Repeated ship-post updates collapse to one entry per session, and selecting
  an item opens that exact shipped transcript ready for review or follow-up.

## July 29, 2026 - Safe concurrent delivery (v0.1.99)

- Every LFG coding session now works in its own isolated checkout, including
  sessions changing LFG itself, so concurrent agents cannot overwrite one
  another in the live deployment tree.
- Session changes land on current main through a repository-wide lock, then
  rebuild and restart the local service at that exact revision.
- Shipped completion now stays open and reports what remains whenever work is
  uncommitted, missing from main, or not yet deployed locally.

## July 29, 2026 - omg.dev hosted branding (v0.1.98)

- Hosted Computer sessions now replace the LFG mark with the coral omg mark
  and omg.dev wordmark on desktop, while mobile keeps a compact mark-only
  header.
- The hosted desktop project selector now uses the same neutral outlined folder
  treatment as the mobile composer without changing standalone LFG branding.

## July 29, 2026 - Shipped follow-ups (v0.1.97)

- Finished work in the Shipped feed now has a **Follow up** action that starts
  a separate session with the original transcript as context, preserving the
  completed source session while carrying the work forward.
- The follow-up composer supports agent, model, reasoning, prompt, and file
  choices, then opens the newly created session directly in Live.

## July 29, 2026 - Hosted attachment uploads (v0.1.96)

- File attachments now use the host application's authenticated LFG transport,
  so uploads from embedded Computer sessions reach the connected runtime
  instead of failing against the dashboard origin.

## July 29, 2026 - Edge-to-edge mobile scrolling (v0.1.95)

- Every mobile page now scrolls edge-to-edge behind the floating navigation,
  with a soft blur and fade instead of a hard content boundary.
- Live, Shipped, and Artifacts also scroll behind the persistent composer while
  matching top and bottom padding keeps every item fully reachable.

## July 29, 2026 - Single app dependency (v0.1.94)

- `@lfg-dev/app` now exports its signed transport factory and public transport
  types, so React hosts install one application package instead of declaring
  the app's nested client dependency a second time.

## July 29, 2026 - Full application package (v0.1.93)

- LFG now publishes its exact standalone application as `@lfg-dev/app`, so
  React hosts render the same desktop rail, mobile cards, session sheets, and
  composers without an iframe or a second visual implementation.
- The full application accepts one host-owned signed transport for every HTTP
  request and live WebSocket, keeps its navigation in memory, and scopes its
  stylesheet to the mounted host surface.
- Release packaging now produces the application tarball once and includes it
  alongside the protocol, client, and smaller React surface packages.

## July 29, 2026 - Finished sessions (v0.1.92)

- Successful agent work now posts its final result, leaves the live fleet
  automatically, and remains available to resume whenever follow-up is needed.
- Finished conversations now use the same transcript rendering as live
  sessions, with full history and a one-tap Resume action.

## July 29, 2026 - Native session rail polish (v0.1.91)

- The native Computer session rail now swipes cleanly on mobile with subtle
  item snapping and no exposed browser scrollbar.

## July 29, 2026 - Clean workspace builds (v0.1.90)

- Release runners now compile the shared workspace packages before the
  standalone frontend, so a clean checkout builds without cached output.

## July 29, 2026 - Deterministic package releases (v0.1.89)

- Version tags now have one release publisher, preventing local and hosted
  release jobs from racing to write the same assets.
- Package archives are cleaned before each build, so a release can contain
  only the protocol, client, and React packages for its own version.

## July 29, 2026 - Native Computer surfaces (v0.1.88)

- LFG now ships versioned protocol, client, and React packages so trusted
  hosts can render sessions directly without booting the full app in an iframe.
- The embeddable client owns one shared live connection with batched
  subscriptions and reconnect resume, while the standalone LFG app uses the
  same request transport.
- A stable Computer shell and matching session, transcript, status, and
  composer surfaces are available immediately while runtime data loads.

## July 29, 2026 - Session rail polish (v0.1.87)

- The desktop session list now fades softly at the top and bottom of its scroll
  view, making overflow feel intentional while keeping every row interactive.

## July 29, 2026 - Connected Claude SDK sessions (v0.1.86)

- The default embedded Claude session now uses the connected Claude Code
  account, instead of allowing omg's built-in proxy variables to override it.
- Computers without a connected Claude account continue using the existing
  platform runtime unchanged.

## July 29, 2026 - Prompt Stash recovery (v0.1.85)

- Typed and dictated prompts are now saved automatically in a browser-local
  Stash, so refreshing, navigating away, or a failed send no longer loses the
  text.
- Resume now combines Stash history and resumable sessions in a compact desktop
  dialog and a discoverable mobile drawer.

## July 29, 2026 - Connected Claude sessions (v0.1.84)

- Hosted Computers now launch Claude Code with the user's connected Claude
  account instead of letting omg's built-in Anthropic proxy override it, so a
  successful sign-in can immediately start real sessions.
- Computers without a connected Claude account keep using the existing
  platform runtime unchanged.

## July 29, 2026 - Personal agent connections (v0.1.83)

- Hosted Computers now distinguish omg's built-in runtime access from a
  user's own Claude Code or Codex account, so every new user sees the connect
  step until they personally sign in.
- A completed Claude Code sign-in is recognized on the next status check,
  letting the Computer open immediately without waiting for a credential cache.

## July 28, 2026 - Embedded Computer agent connection (v0.1.82)

- A fresh hosted Computer now offers Claude Code and Codex sign-in directly
  inside LFG, using the existing provider login dialogs and without requiring
  iMessage or showing a provisioning progress bar.
- Starting the first session sends one origin-checked event to the omg host so
  the $49 keep-your-Computer offer appears only after the Computer is useful.

## July 28, 2026 - Hosted animations resume reliably (v0.1.81)

- Hosted Computer activity animations now resume after returning from another
  tab or window, without reloading or interrupting the live coding session.

## July 28, 2026 - Merged branch badges (v0.1.80)

- Session change badges now switch from the neutral Review treatment to a
  green check and Merged label once the branch is merged.
- New edits or commits made after a merge return the badge to Review, keeping
  the displayed branch state accurate.

## July 28, 2026 - Transcript indexing no longer stalls serve (v0.1.79)

- Indexing a transcript message used to scan the entire search mirror, so a
  busy install would pin a CPU core and stop accepting connections — pages hung
  and the Computer looked disconnected while both services reported healthy.
  Indexing is now a constant-time lookup.
- Upgrading rebuilds the search mirror once on first start, about 8 seconds per
  200k indexed messages. Nothing is re-read from disk and no history is lost.

## July 28, 2026 - Hosted desktop project switcher restored (v0.1.78)

- Hosted desktop workspaces once again show the folder/project selector in the
  session rail, while account and settings controls remain owned by the host.

## July 28, 2026 - Durable sessions across every resume path (v0.1.77)

- Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi retain their full indexed conversation when
  resumed, and Grok and Cursor sessions can now be resumed from their native
  histories in the same picker.
- The live managed-session roster now stays in memory for fast reads while
  persisting every mutation atomically, so a serve crash or restart rehydrates
  the intact session list instead of losing or briefly emptying it.

## July 28, 2026 - Codex resume history restored (v0.1.76)

- Resuming a file-backed Codex session now imports its conversation before the
  new agent starts, preventing successful resumes from opening as an empty chat.

## July 28, 2026 - Desktop embed drops bottom host pad (v0.1.75)

- When framed in omg at desktop width (lg+), host bottom inset cancels so the
  composer no longer sits above a ghost empty band. Mobile embed still clears
  the bottom Computer/Settings pill.

## July 28, 2026 - Local Computer conversation manager (v0.1.74)

- Connected Computers can now run lightweight conversation reasoning locally
  through a versioned manager protocol while the calling service retains
  privileged tool execution.
- Retried manager rounds are deduplicated durably, preventing duplicate local
  model requests during relay reconnects or Computer wake-up.

## July 28, 2026 - Reliable hosted session focus (v0.1.73)

- Hosted Computer links read their target session directly from the browser
  address during startup, so a slow router bootstrap cannot leave an older
  session open inside an otherwise-correct iframe URL.

## July 28, 2026 - Stable hosted session deep links (v0.1.72)

- Hosted Computer sessions keep their session and embed address while focus is
  resolved, preventing a redundant navigation from returning the iframe to the
  generic LFG home or identity picker.

## July 28, 2026 - Standalone device pad, cancel when embedded (v0.1.71)

- Standalone LFG restores the original home-indicator padding under Start.
- When framed in omg, that device pad cancels out so only the host-pill inset
  remains — no double gap, no flush-to-edge composer.

## July 28, 2026 - Tighten embed bottom pad on PWA (v0.1.70)

- When framed in omg, bottom safe padding is host-pill only (no stacked device
  home-indicator), and the home Start row no longer double-counts that band —
  so the large empty gap under the composer on the iOS PWA is gone while the
  session Message bar still clears the Computer/Settings pill.

## July 28, 2026 - Global safe bottom for embed (v0.1.69)

- Session chat and every other bottom surface now pad with a global
  `--lfg-safe-bottom` token (device home-indicator + omg Computer host pill), so
  the Message composer no longer sits under the floating Computer/Settings
  controls when framed in omg.

## July 28, 2026 - Reliable live-stream returns (v0.1.68)

- Returning to LFG after switching tabs or desktops now detects and replaces a
  half-dead live connection automatically, restoring transcript updates without
  requiring a page refresh.

## July 28, 2026 - OpenCode permission recovery (v0.1.67)

- OpenCode sessions no longer remain stuck on Working when a tool needs
  permission: attached LFG uploads are approved once automatically, while other
  requests surface Allow once, Always allow, and Deny choices and time out
  safely when unattended.

## July 27, 2026 - Embed host bottom inset (v0.1.66)

- When framed inside omg Computer, content lifts with a tight internal bottom
  inset so the compact host nav no longer covers the composer, while LFG's
  background still paints full-bleed under the pill (no color mismatch).

## July 27, 2026 - Embed mode for omg Computer (v0.1.65)

- When framed inside omg (or with `?embed=1`), LFG hides its own header,
  settings, user picker, and onboarding so the host product owns that chrome.
- Embedded mode defaults to all sessions and does not overwrite standalone
  filter preferences.
- Session deep-links (`?session=`) prioritize Live from first paint so the
  target session focuses faster.

## July 27, 2026 - Dismissible agent questions (v0.1.64)

- Agent questions can now be dismissed without sending a reply, including when
  another action resolves the question at the same time.
- The mobile question screen now opens directly on the question card without
  the redundant page header.

## July 26, 2026 - Codex models in the OpenCode picker (v0.1.63)

- When OpenCode is signed in with a ChatGPT Plus/Pro account, the model picker
  now offers the latest Codex models (gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-5.6-terra, gpt-5.6-luna,
  gpt-5.5, and friends) for OpenCode sessions and auto agents, and newly
  released gpt models appear automatically after the daily catalog refresh.

## July 26, 2026 - Clean OpenCode streaming (v0.1.62)

- OpenCode sessions no longer echo the initial user prompt as temporary
  assistant output while a response is streaming.

## July 26, 2026 - Warm feeds and native groundwork (v0.1.61)

- Shipped, Artifacts, and the session list no longer cold-reload on every tab
  switch. List data is cached client-side (stale-while-revalidate, same idea as
  transcripts), those pages stay warm in the background after the first visit so
  gallery iframes don't reboot, and the feeds are prefetched during idle so the
  first open can paint from cache too.
- Auto findings can now be copied as a structured reference for use in an
  existing session, with that handoff recorded alongside reply, execute, and
  dismiss actions.
- Recurring auto findings are escalated instead of being silently treated as
  duplicates.
- Usage Campfire agents now fly naturally onto their arc and handle touch
  selection without accidental overlay dismissal.
- A documented Expo SDK 57 mobile prototype now establishes the native
  toolchain, navigation, persistence, glass experiments, and TestFlight path.

## July 26, 2026 - Reproducible motion release (v0.1.60)

- Release installs now include the complete Number Flow dependency lock data,
  so the organic activity and motion update builds reliably from a clean
  checkout.

## July 26, 2026 - Organic activity and smoother motion (v0.1.59)

- Pending user messages and live agent tool calls now share a layered organic
  colour wash, halo and crisp edge instead of a mechanical gradient sweep.
  When activity finishes, the effect fades away smoothly rather than vanishing.
- Newly sent messages now spring from the composer's actual on-screen position,
  staying spatially correct with the soft keyboard, attachments, multiline
  prompts and multi-column sessions.
- Dialogs, dropdowns, context menus and alerts now use one consistent motion
  scale, with reduced-motion fallbacks throughout.
- Live reasoning labels remain readable while their highlight moves, rather
  than fading toward invisible at the ends of the shimmer.
- The Usage Campfire's "next restore" now counts down to the second, with each
  unit rolling on its own instead of the whole line swapping once a second.
- Agent marks in the campfire are larger again.
- On touch, tapping an agent now highlights it and retargets the readout; a
  second tap on the same agent starts the session. Previously a single tap fired
  straight into the composer, before you could read anything.

## July 25, 2026 - Start a session from the campfire (v0.1.58)

- Clicking an agent in the Usage Campfire now picks that agent in the composer
  and opens it, so the campfire is a launcher as well as a readout. It resolves
  to whichever variant of that agent this box actually has configured.
- The agent logo leads each node at roughly double its old size, with the usage
  meter shrunk to a compact ring beside its own percentage underneath.
- Agent marks now cast a shape-tracing glow rather than a rectangular shadow,
  which was drawing a box behind the transparent logos.

## July 25, 2026 - Clean session pins (v0.1.57)

- Deleted sessions are now removed from browser-local pinned state instead of
  lingering in the frontend and resurfacing as stale UI.
- Closing a pinned session also dismisses its open mobile detail sheet, while
  pins in other project or owner filters remain intact.

## July 25, 2026 - Campfire, cleaned up (v0.1.56)

- The Usage Campfire now only shows agents that actually report usage —
  unconfigured providers no longer sit on the arc as greyed-out placeholders
  that read as broken.
- Hovering (or tapping) an agent retargets the centre readout to that agent's
  own next restore. If an agent doesn't report a reset time, the centre shows
  how much of its window is spent instead, so a hover always answers something.
- Loading is a real state now: ember arcs spin in place on the arc while limits
  are read, instead of an ellipsis and a static dash.
- Dropped the glass cards. Each agent is just its meter, name and percentage on
  the ember background, and the hovered one lifts while the rest recede.
- Ring colour now tracks each window's own utilization on a shared scale, so a
  ring means the same thing as the number beneath it. The previous colours were
  assigned by position and encoded nothing.
- The green/amber/red utilization scale was re-picked for colour-vision
  deficiency — the old green and amber were nearly indistinguishable to deutan
  viewers (ΔE 6.6, well under the safe floor).
- Fixed: on narrow phones the outermost agents were clipped off both edges. The
  arc is now sized from the space actually available.

## July 25, 2026 - Instant transcripts and a calmer workspace (v0.1.55)

- Opening a session is now instant. The transcript pane used to clear itself
  and refetch every time you opened a session — even one you had open seconds
  earlier — so it always waited on a full network round trip. Transcripts are
  now cached and repainted immediately, and the sessions you are most likely to
  open next are warmed in the background. On a slow connection this took
  session opens from roughly 1.7s to under 0.3s.
- The Shipped and Artifacts galleries load much faster. The artifact index is
  cached instead of rebuilt per request, and gallery tiles no longer boot a
  live iframe apiece just to render a thumbnail.
- The composer is now one shared component everywhere it appears, so the
  session view, the new-session bar, and mobile all behave identically —
  along with a single consistent status dot.
- The chat input grows with what you type, the focused stage column is easier
  to pick out at a glance, and the desktop rail has a right-click context menu.
  Long session subtitles in the rail are clamped to two lines.
- New keyboard shortcuts for opening Settings and toggling the sidebar.
- Idle sessions can be cleared in bulk directly from the sessions list.
- Agent-facing MCP payloads are slimmer and use short session ids, so agents
  spend less of their context on session bookkeeping.
- Fixed: the OpenCode backend now streams real tool arguments and results
  instead of placeholders, and no longer collides on port 4096.
- Usage Campfire: press bare **Shift** to toggle a full-screen arc of every
  agent's rate limits around a live "next restore" countdown (press Shift again,
  Esc, or click outside to close). On mobile, long-press the composer activity
  rings.
- `lfg agents auto` can now create and manage auto agents over their full
  lifecycle from the CLI.
- Fixed: the image annotator now renders above the composer dialog instead of
  behind it.

## July 25, 2026 - Quieter mobile starts and reliable ask replies (v0.1.54)

- The empty mobile live view is now a quiet, unboxed status marker instead of
  a large card that duplicated the persistent new-session composer. The
  redundant button, obsolete v2 instructions, and visible versioned startup
  copy are gone.
- Ask prompts now expire cleanly when their session is no longer waiting, and
  pivoting to a different task no longer gets mistaken for answering the old
  question.

## July 24, 2026 - Opus 5 voice advisor and a two-verb agent channel (v0.1.53)

- The voice advisor now runs on Claude Opus 5, falling back to Sonnet 5, and
  is fixed for how those models think. It used to share the voice brain's small
  reply budget; because the new models reason before answering and that
  reasoning draws on the same budget, hard questions would have come back
  truncated or silent. The advisor now has its own, much larger budget while
  the brain keeps its fast one. Consults that act on the fleet mid-answer also
  no longer fail partway through.
- Agents talk to you through two verbs instead of a scattered set of tools:
  one for telling you things (running narration in the thread, evidence and
  reports inside the session, finished work on the Shipped feed) and one for
  asking (a question for you, or a consult with the advisor). Agents are now
  expected to narrate as they work rather than going quiet for long stretches,
  and to make the reasonable call themselves instead of stopping to check in.
  Existing tools keep working.
- Ended and historical sessions are searchable again — find past sessions by
  id, owner, project, text, or when they were last active.

## July 24, 2026 - Real page URLs and relayed live views (v0.1.52)

- Every page now has its own URL. The dashboard uses real paths
  (`/settings`, `/usage`, `/coding-agents`, and so on), so the browser
  back/forward buttons work across pages, any page is directly shareable, and
  a page survives a hard refresh.
- Session deep links (`/?session=<id>`) now reliably open the linked session —
  including on mobile, on a first-run browser still behind the profile picker,
  and when the session belongs to another profile — and say so clearly when the
  session has already ended instead of silently doing nothing.
- The live session view — streaming transcript and live status — now works for
  sessions opened through a connected relay, not just the local dashboard, by
  tunneling the session's live WebSocket and SSE streams over the relay's
  existing outbound socket.
- Auto-agent findings and ask-user questions now reach relay-connected surfaces.
- Newly created session cards show a "started" badge so fresh sessions are easy
  to spot in the live view.
- Fixed a chat issue that could spin the transcript in a scroll/update loop.

## July 23, 2026 - Origin channel delivery (v0.1.51)

- Agents can now intentionally send text, screenshots, and videos back to the
  channel that launched their session through the channel-neutral
  `lfg_send_to_origin` MCP tool.
- Deliveries stay bound to their owning session, while phone numbers and
  transport credentials remain exclusively with the channel adapter.

## July 23, 2026 - Reliable mobile bundle (v0.1.50)

- Restored the mobile bottom-edge gesture guard to the published source so
  the web UI builds cleanly while protecting iOS Home and app-switching
  gestures.

## July 23, 2026 - Connected session links (v0.1.49)

- Connected computers can now advertise their public URL with
  `lfg connect --url`, or through `LFG_PUBLIC_URL`, so relays can preserve
  exact links back to individual sessions.
- Session deep links and shipped-result media now flow through connected
  relays, making remote completion messages more useful outside the LFG
  dashboard.

## July 22, 2026 - Faster, clearer session workflows (v0.1.48)

- Attachments now start uploading as soon as they are selected, and large files
  transfer in resilient 8 MB chunks so sending a message rarely waits on file
  bytes and oversized requests are less fragile.
- Desktop session actions are clearer and more dependable: Fork dialogs stay
  bright above their backdrop, sent messages remain right-aligned, and session
  references can be copied directly from the action menu.
- Settings now reports host disk usage alongside CPU and memory, including a
  capacity bar that calls out elevated utilization.
- Voice handoffs use natural conversational holds without exposing internal
  advisor, model, or session terminology.
- Optional `lfg connect` lifecycle notifications now ignore subagents and
  short-lived top-level sessions, keeping remote completion alerts focused on
  meaningful work.

## July 20, 2026 - Visible mobile selection (v0.1.47)

- Selecting text from a sent-message bubble now keeps the native highlight and
  selection handles above the glass card instead of clipping them underneath it.

## July 20, 2026 - Faster message sharing (v0.1.46)

- Every user and assistant message now has a one-tap copy action. On mobile,
  long-pressing message text opens quick Copy and Select text actions, so people
  can either grab the whole response immediately or use native selection handles.
- `lfg connect` can now optionally forward session completed/needs-attention
  events to the relay it's paired with (`LFG_CONNECT_EVENTS=1`, off by
  default — session titles leave the box when enabled). See the "Session
  lifecycle events" section in the README's `lfg connect` docs.

## July 20, 2026 - Smart session cleanup (v0.1.45)

- Smart clear and other LFG-managed agents can now close sessions through the
  supported MCP surface after resolving an exact session id.
- Session closing refuses self-termination, and capability guidance now reports
  a refresh only for genuinely stale sessions instead of masking missing tools.

## July 20, 2026 - Responsive chat and resilient indexing (v0.1.44)

- Session and bootstrap requests no longer fan out eager transcript-page reads
  across the fleet, eliminating the load amplification that stalled chat,
  artifacts, voice, and the connection ping together.
- Message delivery now resolves sessions through the shared live cache, avoiding
  a full process and tmux discovery pass on every send.
- Artifact refreshes fail fast and retry their SQLite mirror when another writer
  is active; scheduled refreshes can no longer crash or freeze the LFG server,
  and durable manifests reconcile automatically after restart.
- Transcript write transactions acquire the SQLite writer lock up front, trace
  pages are sampled with seven-day retention, and database planner/search
  metadata is repaired and optimized during rollout.

## July 19, 2026 - Consistent live media and connection health (v0.1.43)

- Settings now shows the real browser-to-server WebSocket ping, refreshed every
  five seconds with clear live, reconnecting, and offline states.
- Transcript media now has one explicit, atomic placement and ordering path.
  Gallery and Shipped assets can no longer leak into chat, empty cards are
  suppressed, stable artifact ownership remains singular, and legacy orphaned
  or misclassified placements are repaired during migration.
- Transcript reads no longer scan and rewrite artifact metadata or run one JSON
  poller per open pane, restoring millisecond artifact delivery and responsive
  local API requests on large indexes.
- `lfg connect` — a new generic remote-access relay client. Lets a
  self-hosted box be reached through an operator-run relay without opening
  any inbound port: the box dials out over a WebSocket, authenticates with a
  one-time pairing code (then a persisted bearer token), and proxies HTTP
  traffic onto its own local `lfg serve`. No relay implementation ships with
  LFG — `LFG_RELAY_URL` is a required, provider-agnostic setting (see the
  README's "lfg connect" section and the wire protocol documented in
  `src/commands/connect.ts`).

## July 18, 2026 - Transferable live dashboards (v0.1.42)

- Re-publishing a stable HTML artifact id from a later session now updates the
  same dashboard, transfers ownership and refresh control, and continues its
  existing revision history.

## July 18, 2026 - Correct Pi and Copilot icons (v0.1.41)

- Pi now uses its official block logo instead of a generic pi glyph, with a
  fresh cache version so the corrected artwork appears immediately.
- Pi and GitHub Copilot icons are now served by the production static-asset
  route, fixing missing icons outside the development server.

## July 18, 2026 - Custom agent profiles (v0.1.40)

- Agents can now load a custom profile from a directory (`LFG_PI_PROFILE_DIR`):
  extra system-prompt text, a skills directory, and a display name — injected
  via pi's native `--append-system-prompt`/`--skill` flags. Lets operators
  brand and specialize managed pi sessions without forking LFG.

## July 18, 2026 - More agents and reliable mobile layers (v0.1.39)

- Pi and GitHub Copilot are now first-class coding-agent choices across setup,
  session creation, model selection, and managed launches.
- Agents receive the LFG presentation workflow automatically, including visual
  verification, live artifact publishing, and shipped-work showcases.
- Script-backed artifacts can be refreshed manually, and desktop trackpad
  gestures can cycle the active project without leaving the live view.
- Mobile nested surfaces now stack correctly: Fork stays above an open chat,
  and the model selector drawer fully covers its originating control pop-up.

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot CLI** (`@github/copilot`, binary `copilot`) as an 8th supported coding agent:
  - Settings → Coding agents tile with binary + auth status checks. Auth precedence: `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` > `GH_TOKEN` > `GITHUB_TOKEN`, falling back to a real login artifact (`~/.copilot/hosts.yml`, `config.json`, or `session-state/`) rather than a bare `~/.copilot/` directory.
  - Tmux-transport session launcher `spawnManagedCopilotSession` wired through `serve.ts` so `agent=copilot` requests dispatch to Copilot instead of falling back to Claude. Launches interactively via Copilot's supported `-i, --interactive <prompt>` flag, which starts a long-lived TUI and auto-executes the initial prompt (no `-p` one-shot, no send-keys polling).
  - `--allow-all-tools` is opt-in through `LFG_COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL_TOOLS=1`. Off by default because LFG's agent slice is resource containment, not a filesystem/network sandbox.
  - Curated model catalog: `claude-sonnet-4.5` (default), `claude-sonnet-4`, `gpt-5`.
  - `scripts/setup.sh` installs `@github/copilot` when `LFG_INSTALL_COPILOT=1` (requires Node 22+), pinned to `LFG_COPILOT_VERSION` (default `1.0.71`) for reproducibility and to avoid GHSA-g8r9-g2v8-jv6f (`<=0.0.422`, prompt-injection RCE via shell parameter expansion) and GHSA-9ccr-r5hg-74gf (`<=1.0.42`, `core.fsmonitor` RCE via nested bare repo).
  - New `LFG_COPILOT_PATH`, `LFG_COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL_TOOLS`, and `LFG_COPILOT_VERSION` env overrides.

## July 16, 2026 - Shipped feed and live artifacts (v0.1.37)

- New Shipped channel: a feed of agent-published work, available as a virtual
  page in the project menu with kind filters (all/html/image/video), live HTML
  previews, load-more paging, tweet-style posts with real agent-kind bylines,
  and `?tab=` deep links.
- HTML artifacts are now updatable: a persisted script refresh runner (also
  exposed over MCP) re-renders them on demand, with visible refresh state,
  stable revisions across data refreshes, clean cancellation, and deletion.
- Added a native full-page artifact viewer and a dedicated all-artifacts
  gallery; tapping a post opens the session that shipped it.
- Mobile swipe polish: no more composer-bar or mid-swipe flashes when changing
  project pages, and the right nav island stays identical across swipe pages.
- Subagents launched inside a slice are now bound to their transcript via
  cgroup, fixing misattributed output; agent swarms get bounded memory and
  concurrency.

## July 15, 2026 - Durable sessions and faster image viewing (v0.1.36)

- Session worktrees now live under a persistent LFG-managed root instead of a
  temporary directory, and Claude and Codex resume flows show full history.
- Image artifacts now use cached, size-bounded WebP previews in transcripts and
  the lightbox, reducing transfer and decode costs while preserving originals.
- Image display retries no longer create duplicate transcript entries when the
  shared SQLite index is busy; durable artifacts succeed and reconcile into the
  ordered message stream, with a short idempotency window for agent retries.
- Refined session-management and resume surfaces, including modal layering,
  keyboard handling, and responsive navigation behavior.

## July 14, 2026 - Desktop polish and upload progress (v0.1.35)

- Refreshed the desktop navigation rail, header, and session stage to match the
  mobile visual language, with improved glass surfaces, spacing, and controls.
- File attachments now show real per-file upload percentages and progress bars
  in both active-session and new-session composers, including concurrent files.
- Fixed the desktop Manage Sessions menu trigger for Base UI compatibility.

## July 14, 2026 - Installable app and resilient recovery (v0.1.34)

- Added a discoverable PWA install flow on desktop and mobile, including the
  native Chromium prompt, guided Apple installation steps, standalone detection,
  and proper platform, maskable, and Apple touch icons.
- Managed SDK sessions now keep a durable resume record with their model,
  project, and assigned user, so closed or restarted sessions can be recovered
  reliably. OpenCode sessions also participate in the agent filters and model
  pickers throughout the web UI.
- Theme choices now persist across reloads, and voice provider API keys can be
  configured securely from the setup dialog.
- The Manage Sessions launcher now stays accessible in the appropriate desktop
  and mobile navigation positions, and the OMG badge points to the correct
  template page.

## July 14, 2026 - Ready-by-default live sessions (v0.1.33)

- WebSocket live transcripts are now the default for the server and web client,
  so a standard install no longer needs `LIVE_TRANSPORT=ws`. Set it explicitly
  to `sse` only for compatibility with a proxy that cannot upgrade WebSockets.

## July 14, 2026 - Sandbox-safe release updates (v0.1.32)

- Release setup and in-app updates now ignore host-injected tar defaults,
  replace the prior application bundle explicitly, and avoid restoring archive
  ownership, permissions, or timestamps that restricted sandbox filesystems can
  reject.
- Existing folders initialized as new Git repositories can now launch their
  first coding-agent session before an initial commit exists. That first session
  runs in the selected folder; normal isolated worktrees resume after HEAD is
  created.

## July 13, 2026 - Blank-project picker fixes (v0.1.31)

- Fresh installs now create their configured repository root when the project
  browser first opens, so a missing `~/repos` no longer blocks listing or
  creating a project.
- The live composer project control now displays the selected project name, and
  newly browsed or created folders become the active composer project
  immediately.

## July 13, 2026 - Live install logs during onboarding (v0.1.30)

- Onboarding now streams the real installer output in a single live log while a
  batch install runs, instead of painting the same synthetic progress bar on
  every selected agent. Each agent row shows a simple **Installing…** state and
  the shared log tells you exactly what setup is doing.
- Backend captures stdout and stderr from the shared `setup.sh` run and exposes
  it at `GET /api/coding-agents/setup/log`.

## July 13, 2026 - Reliable OMG onboarding installs (v0.1.29)

- Fixed the onboarding batch endpoint being shadowed by the generic per-agent
  route, which caused a correct multi-agent request to fail with
  **unknown coding agent**.
- OMG template installs now record their release channel and repository, so
  Settings can check releases and enable supervisor-aware updates.

## July 13, 2026 - Repeatable setup on OMG (v0.1.28)

- OMG agent-template installs now recognize their existing guest supervisor, so
  **Update & restart** can safely install a release and relaunch LFG.
- Onboarding displays the exact LFG version being configured.
- Settings now includes **Redo onboarding**, which reopens the full walkthrough
  without deleting existing profiles, repositories, or sessions.

## July 13, 2026 - Batch agent installation (v0.1.27)

- Onboarding now lets users choose coding agents with individual checkboxes or
  Select all, then installs the complete selection in one setup run.
- Selected agents share installation progress while already configured agents
  are left untouched.

## July 13, 2026 - Ready-to-run local projects (v0.1.26)

- New projects now initialize a `main` branch and commit their starter README
  before appearing in the project picker, so the first session can always
  create its isolated Git worktree.
- Local projects without an `origin/main` remote now correctly use their local
  `main` commit as the worktree base.
- Failed project setup rolls back the new folder instead of leaving a partial
  project behind.

## July 13, 2026 - UI sound & haptics, composer polish (v0.1.25)

- Added UI sound effects and haptic feedback across the app: a light press
  tick on buttons, distinct on/off tones on toggles, a send whoosh, tab-switch
  and agent-swipe cues, and success/error chimes on toasts. Sounds are
  synthesized (no assets) and both are toggleable in Settings → Feedback
  (default on); `haptic()` now respects the haptics setting everywhere.
- Reworked the inline composer's controls into two animated mini-cards (agents,
  then model/thinking/project) emitted from the agent icon.
- Polished the session assign menu with avatar chips matching the user filter.
- Kept the terminal surface dark regardless of theme.
- Extended the source updater to support release installs alongside Git installs.

## July 13, 2026 - Source auto-update (v0.1.24)

- Added an update panel in Settings for Git/source installs that checks
  `origin/main`, reports available commits, and can update with one click.
- Source updates require a clean `main` checkout, fast-forward safely, install
  locked dependencies, rebuild the web UI, and restart the managed systemd or
  launchd service before reconnecting the browser.
- Added coverage for up-to-date, behind, dirty, and non-main checkout states.
- Refreshed the web lockfile so frozen CI installs include the AI SDK packages
  already declared by the web app.

## July 13, 2026 - Native project picker & clean MCP images (v0.1.23)

- Replaced the composer's native repo select with a mobile-friendly project
  sheet that lists project paths and makes browsing or creating a project a
  first-class action.
- The inline composer now opens the same project sheet from its folder button,
  keeping project selection consistent across composer layouts.
- Stopped MCP image results from emitting redundant Markdown URLs that could
  render as broken images; clients continue to receive the structured artifact.

## July 12, 2026 - Fix agent-icon swipe gesture (v0.1.22)

Follow-up to v0.1.21: the swipe-to-switch gesture didn't actually fire.

- The agent icon `<img>` is draggable by default, so a press-drag started a
  native image drag and fired `pointercancel` after the first move — killing
  the swipe before it crossed threshold. The icon is now `draggable={false}` /
  `pointer-events-none`.
- Reworked the gesture to pointer events (one path for mouse-drag, touch and
  pen) tracked on `window` so the drag survives the pointer leaving the 32px
  target, and Base UI's press-to-open is suppressed so a swipe never also opens
  the popover (tap still opens it). Verified end-to-end in a headless browser.
- Note: the inline composer that hosts this icon is the mobile home screen
  (viewport ≤ 767px); on wider/desktop layouts the agent switcher is the
  button row inside the composer controls.

## July 12, 2026 - Swipe-to-switch agent & cached agent icons (v0.1.21)

The composer's agent icon is now a quick gesture target, and agent icons stop
re-downloading on a timer.

- Swipe up/down (or trackpad-scroll) on the inline composer's agent icon to step
  through the visible agents, with a slide+fade animation; tapping still opens
  the full agent/model popover.
- Agent icons are now versioned (`?v=…`) and served `immutable` for a year, so
  they load once and never re-fetch on subsequent renders. Other static assets
  gained `ETag`/`Last-Modified` revalidation (cheap 304s) instead of a bare
  5-minute `max-age` that forced full re-downloads.
- Media artifacts are indexed into the transcript index so images obey the same
  pagination boundary as prose instead of appending to whichever page loaded.
- Added "use this folder" / "create new folder" project onboarding (with
  `git init`) in the repo store.
- Coding-agent setup reports progress, and Claude/Codex login commands use the
  device-auth / `--claudeai` flows.

## July 11, 2026 - Auto-agent picker parity (v0.1.20)

Auto agents can use the same providers as new sessions, and the settings sheets
use shorter copy.

- Auto-agent create/edit/finding sheets now offer Claude, Codex, Grok, Cursor,
  and OpenCode (filtered by coding-agent visibility), matching the session
  picker.
- Added headless runners for Grok and Cursor auto agents.
- Tightened auto-agent settings labels and placeholders.
- Kept display images in transcript order, and improved cursor-agent busy
  detection plus the Grok session model fallback.

## July 9, 2026 - Direct transcript indexing & a single chat state (v0.2.0)

Managed sessions no longer read or write transcript JSONL: all three SDK
harnesses (Claude, Codex, OpenCode) index their message streams straight into
SQLite, and the web chat pane now runs entirely on AI SDK `useChat`.

- Claude, Codex, and OpenCode managed sessions run on their official SDKs and
  index messages directly into SQLite under `lfg://session/<id>` keys — opening
  a chat is one ~2ms DB read, with no transcript files in the loop.
- Migrated the web chat pane to `@ai-sdk/react` `useChat` as the single state
  system: history is fetched per open, live updates append through the shared
  WebSocket subscription, and duplicate handling lives in exactly one place.
- Fixed live-view blindness after a serve restart: snapshot/gap/resumed frames
  are now authoritative resync points instead of being dropped by the stale-seq
  guard, so long-lived pages recover instead of going silent.
- Fixed re-entered chats rendering history-less: message state now survives for
  every subscribed session (not just busy ones), and resume cursors are dropped
  with their subscriptions.
- Fixed Codex sessions silently losing every reply after turn 1 (per-turn item
  id collisions), duplicated transcripts from rollout re-ingestion, and command
  replay storms after a harness restart.
- Fixed tmux Codex transcript discovery: rollouts are inferred by prompt, cwd,
  and time, and the mapping is persisted so transcripts still resolve after the
  pane is gone.
- Streaming drafts reset as each assistant message finalizes, so long
  multi-tool turns no longer accumulate into one duplicated blob.
- Temporarily de-listed the Hermes agent from all pickers and spawn paths to
  focus on the core harnesses (`agent=hermes` now returns a clear error).

## July 5, 2026 - Setup checks & steadier resumes

LFG now exposes setup checks for local MCP registration and keeps resumed
sessions tied to the project they came from.

- Added an LFG MCP setup check in Settings -> Coding agents, including one-click
  registration for Claude and Codex when those CLIs are available.
- Registers the LFG MCP server during setup by default for local Claude/Codex
  installs.
- Preserves project labels across resumed and managed sessions, even when the
  underlying agent reports a stale cwd.
- Makes resumed Claude sessions stay open for follow-up instructions when no
  prompt is provided.
- Tightened recent-session close guards and fixed several mobile UI edge cases.

## July 2, 2026 - Configurable session brain & refreshed UI edges

The session brain can now run on the model you choose, and the interface picks up a consistent gradient-glass edge across buttons, inputs, and surfaces.

- Added a per-config model for the session brain (classify/summarize), seeded from env and adjustable from the Session Brain view; defaults to Sonnet 5.
- Introduced reusable gradient-border and gradient-edged form-field treatments, applied across buttons, inputs, and surfaces.
- Gave the notepad its own bounded scroll area with a scroll-aware edge fade.
- Let session resume carry a prompt and an agent-aware model.
- Fixed live streaming for AI SDK sessions and versioned the service-worker shell cache.

## June 29, 2026 - Safer installs

Fresh installs now leave existing Tailscale Serve settings alone unless you explicitly opt in.

- Skips Tailscale Serve setup by default so lfg does not claim HTTPS 443 on install.
- Adds an opt-in path with `LFG_TAILSCALE_SERVE=1` for private tailnet exposure.
- Protects existing Serve routes from accidental overwrite unless `LFG_TAILSCALE_SERVE_OVERWRITE=1` is set.

## June 29, 2026 - Project-focused live view

Sessions now group cleanly by repo project, with steadier filters and fewer stale worktree entries.

- Collapsed session worktrees into project names for simpler scanning.
- Kept resumed worktrees during cleanup so active sessions do not disappear.
- Removed the extra project-selector arrow for a tighter top bar.

## June 2026 - Agent reliability

Codex and automation paths got stricter defaults and better failure handling.

- Fixed stateless Codex auto-agent runs.
- Added install-channel awareness so update guidance matches source, release, and container installs.
- Stabilized speech playback state to avoid repeated render loops.

## June 2026 - Deployment options

Container deploys and hosted setup docs are now part of the project workflow.

- Added Docker-backed targets for Railway, Fly, Render, Koyeb, DigitalOcean, and Hetzner.
- Published bundled-release flow for cloud installs.
- Documented operational scripts for voice and GPU STT deployments.
