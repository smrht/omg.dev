/**
 * Does a session belong in the list for the currently selected owner filter?
 *
 * "__all" shows everything and "__unassigned" isolates the unclaimed pile.
 * Picking a PERSON shows their sessions plus every unassigned one, and that
 * inclusion is the whole point of this helper.
 *
 * Sessions created through the relay carry no owner at all. The native app
 * authenticates by omg account id and never sends a roster email — there is no
 * identity header on the request, so on a box that DOES have a roster
 * (LFG_USERS) the server has nobody to attribute the session to and leaves it
 * unassigned. `POST /api/sessions/new` only inherits an owner from the nearest
 * assigned ANCESTOR, so a root session from the phone stays ownerless forever.
 *
 * Filtering those out meant live work — a running agent, mid-task — was
 * invisible on the web while the phone showed it, with nothing on screen
 * indicating anything had been hidden. "Unassigned" means nobody has claimed
 * it, not "somebody else's", and hiding a running session from every person
 * view is never the safer default.
