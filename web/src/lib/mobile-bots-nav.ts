 * compact dock above the composer instead, with strict data separation between
 * Chat sessions and persistent Bots.

 * unit-tested logic are the same source instead of two copies that can

 * Flat roster treatment for a bot roster, on every width.
 *
 * The desktop rail roster now renders at this same density. A bot row is the
 * same object on both surfaces — face, name, last line — so it gets one
 * treatment rather than a mobile one and a cramped desktop copy.
 * PR #208 ported the bot-mode mockup's `.roster-row` density
 * (10px vertical padding, 12px gap) verbatim and only got the row pitch from
 * 100px to 84px, because the mockup's own airiness assumes the same large
 * avatar this page renders (`size={56}` in App.tsx) — padding was never the
 * dominant term. `py-2` (8px vertical padding) here pairs with the smaller
 * 44px avatar in App.tsx to bring the row pitch to 68px, in the range of a
 * scannable native list (iOS Messages runs roughly a 52px avatar in a ~76px
 * row) rather than a settings screen.
