// The one owner of browser-side diagnostic events.
//
// This is the client half of the live transport instrumentation described in
// docs/live-ws-protocol.md. Events posted here land in the same daily evlog
// file that the server writes ws_connect / ws_subscribe / ws_backlog to, so a
// single reconnect can be read end to end from one file. Only the browser
// knows the WebSocket close code and the retry count, which is why
// ConnectionStatus.tsx can keep that detail out of the user-facing copy.
//
// This helper used to be defined twice, in useLiveSocket.ts and in App.tsx,
// with identical bodies. Two copies of one helper drift, so there is now one.
