 * agents" wall on a self-hosted install, which is a local setting, not a plan —
 * stays an ordinary error. Matching prose instead would break the next time
 * that sentence is edited.
 *
 * And it is STRUCTURAL, not `instanceof OmgApiError`. An embedding host builds
 * the transport itself, with its OWN copy of @omg-dev/client (see
 * computer-transport-cache.ts on the omg side) — so the error that lands here
 * is an instance of that copy's class, not of the one bundled into this
 * surface. `instanceof` across those two realms is always false, which would
 * make this quietly return false forever on the exact surface the feature
 * exists for.
