// Production SPAs hit a classic failure right after a redeploy: a client still
// running the PREVIOUS build renders a route that pulls in a code-split chunk
// whose hashed filename no longer exists on the server. Our static server falls
// back to serving index.html for any unknown path (SPA routing), so the dynamic
// import() does NOT reject — it "succeeds" with an HTML document parsed as an ES
// module, whose named export is therefore `undefined`. React then throws the
// minified error #306 ("Element type is invalid. Received a promise that
// resolves to: undefined. Lazy element type must resolve to a class or
// function.") and the nearest error boundary blanks the view.
//
// lazyWithReload wraps a dynamic import so that when the expected export is
// missing (or the import outright fails), we force ONE full-page reload to pull
// the fresh index.html and its current chunk hashes — transparently moving the
// user onto the new build. A per-component sessionStorage latch prevents a
// reload loop if the failure is genuine (e.g. the export really was renamed in
// this build), in which case we rethrow so the error boundary can show a
// recoverable fallback instead.
