/**
 * How a session list is grouped, for every surface.
 *
 * A HAND-MAINTAINED COPY of web/src/lib/session-groups.ts. React Native cannot
 * import from web/src, and this repository's answer to that is a copy plus a
 * guard rather than a copy alone — see scripts/check-theme-drift.ts for the
 * same arrangement around the palette. Keep the two in step; the web file is
 * the source of truth for the RULE, this file only restates it.
 *
 * There is one answer now: by folder. The rail and the mobile list used to
 * disagree — the rail grouped by folder when nothing was scoped, mobile
 * grouped by Working and Idle and never by folder — so the same fleet read as
 * two different shapes depending on the window. The phone was the last surface
 * still on the old scheme.
 *
 * Working/Idle is gone. It moved a session between two groups every time it
 * started or stopped, which reordered the list to say something the row
 * already says on its own mark, and it fought the folder grouping: scoped to
 * one folder you saw one scheme, scoped to all you saw the other.
 *
 * Pure so the two surfaces cannot drift again, and so the ordering is testable
 * without a renderer.
