/**
 * Where this client points, and how it decides.
 *
 * The app speaks to a Computer through one of two transports, exactly like the
 * web surface does:
 *
 *   direct  — a box you can already reach on the network (`lfg serve` on your
 *             laptop, over Tailscale). No application-layer auth; the server
 *             has none. Perimeter is the network.
 *   hosted  — omg.dev's session origin, which proxies to your paired machine or
 *             your cloud Computer. Every request carries a signed grant.
 *
 * Keeping both is not hedging. The web app ships both for the same reason:
 * `createSameOriginTransport` for a self-hosted install, `createGrantTransport`
 * for app.omg.dev. A phone is simply never same-origin, so "direct" here is the
 * explicit-base-URL flavour of the same idea.

 * Origin header at all — a browser always sends one on a cross-origin fetch,
 * but React Native's fetch never does, native apps have no origin. Without
 * this, POST /api/auth/sign-out 403s with MISSING_OR_NULL_ORIGIN on every
 * call: the session is never revoked, sign-out silently no-ops server-side,
 * and the app has no way to know because the error is swallowed. The value
 * just needs to be one of the server's fixed trustedOrigins entries — it
 * does not need to describe this app.
