/**
 * An image whose bytes sit behind the transport's grant.
 *
 * Every URL on a Computer — an artifact, or a file the user attached — is
 * served by the session proxy, which requires `Authorization: Bearer <grant>`.
 * React Native's `<Image source={{ uri }}>` issues its own native request and
 * has no way to carry that header, which is why the transcript used to refuse
 * to draw pictures at all and named the file instead.
 *
 * So the bytes are fetched through `client.transport` (the one object that owns
 * the grant, its refresh, and the base URL of the selected machine) and handed
 * to `<Image>` as a data URI. `URL.createObjectURL`, which the web uses for the
 * same job, does not exist on React Native — a data URI is the equivalent that
 * does, and `FileReader.readAsDataURL` is the only conversion RN implements for
 * a Blob.
 *
 * WHY A `preview=1` REQUEST. The server generates a downscaled webp on demand.
 * A phone painting a 240pt tile has no business decoding a 25 MB original, and
 * the whole payload crosses a cellular link — the web surface learned this on
 * its media feed and this file starts where that ended up.

/**
 * The thumbnail, and the viewer it opens into.
 *
 * THE VIEWER IS MODELLED ON PHOTOS, not on a modal with a picture in it. What
 * shipped first was a cross-fade to a full-screen `Image` that closed on any
 * tap, and next to any system app it read as a web lightbox: the picture
 * appeared from nowhere with no relationship to the thing you pressed, and the
 * only way out was a tap, which is not the gesture anybody's thumb reaches for.
 *
 * Three things make the difference, and all three are here:
 *
 *  - IT GROWS FROM THE THUMBNAIL. The tile is measured in window coordinates
 *    on press, and the full-size image is transformed back onto that rect and
 *    released. So the picture you pressed becomes the picture you are looking
 *    at, and closing returns it to where it came from — the continuity iOS
 *    uses everywhere and the reason the transition is legible at all.
 *  - IT FOLLOWS YOUR FINGER OUT. Drag down and the image tracks the drag,
 *    shrinking slightly while the black behind it thins toward the transcript.
 *    Past a threshold — or on a fast flick — it goes home; short of it, it
 *    springs back. A picture that can only be dismissed by a tap feels stuck
 *    to the screen.
 *  - IT ZOOMS. Pinch to 4x, double-tap to 2.5 and back. A screenshot of a
 *    dense dashboard is the common case here and full-screen is still not
 *    enough to read one.
 *
 * PanResponder rather than a gesture library: this app already drives its
 * swipe-to-archive with it, react-native-gesture-handler is present only as
 * somebody else's transitive dependency (undeclared, and this repo has already
 * shipped one binary broken by depending on a module it did not declare), and
 * two fingers of pinch is not enough work to justify taking that risk.
