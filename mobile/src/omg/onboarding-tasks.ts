/**
 * THE ONBOARDING FLOW'S CONTENT, in one place: the first-task cards.
 *
 * Benny, 2026-09-25: onboarding asks one thing, "what should your agent do
 * first?", as a carousel of outcomes. Picking a task card STARTS it. There is
 * no prompt screen to read or edit; the words below are sent as they are, so
 * each one names a result the person can open from the phone.
 *
 * The "agents" card is not a task. It is for people who already use Claude
 * Code or Codex and know what they want to do; it goes to connecting them.
 *
 * It is DATA, not components, because the copy is the part that will be
 * rewritten most and should never require touching a screen to do it.
