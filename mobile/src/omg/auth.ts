/**
 * Sign-in and the short-lived app JWT.
 *
 * Deliberately raw `fetch` against better-auth's REST surface instead of
 * pulling in better-auth's browser client. Two reasons:
 *
 *   1. The browser client's whole job is managing a cookie jar the DOM won't
 *      let it touch. React Native's fetch is backed by NSURLSession / OkHttp,
 *      both of which already persist Set-Cookie across requests, so the session
 *      cookie survives without any of that machinery.
 *   2. It keeps three endpoints of surface area instead of a dependency that
 *      assumes `document` and `location`.
 *
 * The server needs NO change for this: /token authenticates with
 * `auth.api.getSession({ headers })`, which reads the same session cookie the
 * platform jar replays. The `bearer` plugin is not enabled on auth.omg.dev and
 * this path does not need it.
 *
 * Cookie persistence caveat: the jar is process-scoped on both platforms and
 * survives app restarts, but a user who clears app data is signed out. That's
 * the same contract as the web app, so it needs no extra recovery path — the
 * OTP flow simply runs again.
