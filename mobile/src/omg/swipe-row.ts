/**
 * Swipe-to-commit for a list row: drag left to reveal a backdrop action
 * (archive a session, dismiss a finding — whatever the row wants), release
 * past a distance or velocity threshold to commit, otherwise snap back.
 *
 * ONE HOOK, because it used to be two copies. SessionCard (swipe-to-archive)
 * and AutoFindingCard (swipe-to-dismiss, added by #127) carried byte-identical
 * PanResponder logic — same constants, same shape, same bug when one drifted
 * from the other. Tuning arbitration in one place and not the other is the
 * obvious failure mode with two copies; this is the shared primitive instead.
 *
 * PanResponder rather than react-native-gesture-handler: GH resolves in
 * node_modules as a transitive dependency of expo-router/react-native-screens
 * (present in full, native `apple/` source and podspec included — confirmed
 * 2026-08-18), but its native module is NOT in the binary already on devices
 * — checked with `nm` against the installed .app — so importing Swipeable
 * would throw at runtime for anyone on the current build, OTA or not. It only
 * reaches users through a new native build. PanResponder is React Native core
 * and rides along in the JS bundle, so THIS fix reaches the phone over the
 * air; see the PR description for the react-native-gesture-handler tradeoff
 * this project chose not to make here, and why.
 *
 * ARBITRATION AGAINST THE ENCLOSING SCROLLVIEW, RETUNED 2026-08-18, AND THE
 * CEILING THAT TUNING HIT. The row sits in a vertical ScrollView, so
 * `onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture` has to decide, per move event, whether
 * a drag is "the swipe" or "the scroll" — CAPTURE variant, because the card's
 * own PressableScale becomes the responder on touch-start, and a responder is
 * only dislodged by an ancestor asking during the capture phase.
 *
 * The previous gate — `dx < -8 && |dx| > |dy| * 1.5` — read as reasonable
 * directional arbitration on paper and was wrong in practice. Recorded on a
 * real device (iPhone 17 Pro sim): a clean horizontal swipe revealed the
 * backdrop every time; a slow diagonal at dx:dy ratio 1.4 (still a clearly
 * leftward, clearly swipe-shaped gesture to a human) NEVER revealed it, on
 * either row — the ratio required the drag to be 50% more horizontal than
 * vertical, stricter than how a thumb actually moves. That's the
 * "oftentimes" in the bug report.
 *
 * Loosening the ratio to 1.2 did not fix that same 1.4 diagonal — nor did
 * additionally dropping MIN_DX to 4, tried and reverted. Both measured on
 * video, not reasoned from the diff. The actual mechanism: UIScrollView's own
 * pan recognizer evaluates natively, with no bridge round-trip, and arms on
 * the first couple of points of vertical movement regardless of what the
 * touch's overall dx:dy ratio will turn out to be; PanResponder's capture
 * callback answers over the JS bridge, structurally later. On a gesture with
 * ANY real dy, native has usually already won before our callback is even
 * asked. The clean-horizontal case only ever worked because dy stayed ~0 —
 * there was nothing for the native recognizer to arm on, so no race ran at
 * all. No ratio or distance threshold in this file changes that outcome for
 * a genuinely diagonal drag; that is a JS-vs-native latency gap, not a
 * mistuned constant, and closing it needs arbitration that runs where
 * UIScrollView's own recognizer does — which is what
 * react-native-gesture-handler's `failOffsetY`/`activeOffsetX` are for.
 *
 * 1.2 and MIN_DX 10 are kept anyway: real, if partial, improvement — a drag
 * close to horizontal but not laser-straight now claims correctly instead of
 * losing to the old 1.5x gate — and every case tested here (drift-scroll with
 * persistent slight dx, fast flicks, edge-started scrolls) still scrolls
 * clean with no sideways jiggle. It is not the fix for a real diagonal swipe;
 * it is a safe, OTA-reachable improvement while that fix waits on a build.
 *
 * `onPanResponderTerminationRequest` RETURNS FALSE, CHANGED 2026-09-10. The
 * paragraph that used to sit here left it at the RN default (yield) on the
 * grounds that "claims, then gets stolen mid-drag" had never been observed.
 * It has now, logged on the iPhone 17 Pro sim with CGEvent drags of dx -80:
 * at dy 12, 25 and 40 the capture gate claimed at dx -10.7 (dy 1.7 to 5.3
 * at that point), GRANT fired, and a termination request followed within a
 * few moves, from the ScrollView once its native pan armed on the drift.
 * With the default, that request terminated the swipe and the row snapped
 * back: "swipe to archive gets dismissed by a slightly vertical scroll".
 * Refusing it keeps the row under the finger and the backdrop revealed for
 * the whole drag; the list still creeps by the drift's dy underneath, since
 * the native scroll cannot be stopped from JS once it is armed. Vertical
 * scrolls are unaffected: the gate never claims them, so there is nothing
 * to refuse.
