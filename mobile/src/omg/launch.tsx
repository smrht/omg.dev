/**
 * The launch screen: the mark, a line of shimmering text, and a way out.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. The app used to reach the session list before it knew
 * anything, and the list said what it could — which for the first second was
 * "Connecting to …" with an empty machine name, because the bindings had not
 * loaded yet. A sentence naming no computer is worse than no sentence: it is
 * the app admitting, in the first frame someone sees, that it does not know
 * what it is doing. Skeleton cards under it made a second promise the same
 * frame could not keep.
 *
 * So nothing structural is shown until there is something true to say. The
 * mark stays, the caption says which of the two slow things is happening
 * ("Connecting…" / "Waking your computer…"), and the machine's name only
 * appears once there is one.
 *
 * THE SHIMMER IS PER-CHARACTER, not a gradient sweep. A gradient needs a mask
 * to be clipped to glyphs (`@react-native-masked-view` is in the tree but not
 * in package.json — a native module we do not declare is exactly the trap that
 * shipped a broken binary here once already), and an unmasked streak lightens
 * the background as much as the text, which reads as a rectangle passing by. A
 * wave of brightness travelling through the letters needs no native module at
 * all, runs on the UI thread, and is what "shimmer" actually looks like.
 *
 * THE EXIT IS THE POINT. Fading a loading screen out leaves the impression the
 * app was waiting; pushing the mark toward the viewer as it goes reads as the
 * app opening. Caption first (it has nothing more to say), then the mark
 * swells and dissolves, and the surface underneath — already mounted, already
 * laid out — is simply there.

 * THE EXIT IS A ZOOM PAST THE VIEWER, NOT A RESIZE.
 *
 * The first version grew the mark by 35% over 460ms on an ease-OUT curve, and
 * on device that reads as exactly what it is: an icon changing size and then
 * disappearing. Three things were wrong. 1.35x is a size change, not motion
 * toward you. Ease-out means it moves fastest at the START and coasts to a
 * stop — the shape of something settling, when this wants the shape of
 * something launching. And 460ms is long enough to watch.
 *
 * So: a short DIP first (the anticipation every fast move needs — a thing that
 * pulls back before it goes reads as intent rather than a glitch), then an
 * accelerating rush in a quarter of a second.
 *
 * THE FACTOR IS SET BY THE MARK'S SIZE, not chosen for its own sake: the mark
 * has to leave the screen, and every time the mark has shrunk this has had to
 * grow to keep the same overshoot. 7x covered a 64pt mark (448pt against a
 * 393pt-wide phone). The horizontal lockup took the mark to 41pt and this went
 * to 11x. Sizing the mark off the landing's real 0.704 ratio takes it to
 * 28.2pt, where 11x reaches only 310pt and the mark would stop in front of the
 * viewer. 16x restores the margin: 451pt.
