/**
 * Switching which Computer this app talks to — a menu anchored to the machine
 * chip rather than a screen push, because choosing between two machines never
 * justified a whole navigation transition. Every call site shares this one menu
 * instead of hand-rolling its own list.
 *
 * Switching is not managing: pairing, per-machine detail and the blocked-plan
 * escape hatch still live on app/computers.tsx, which this menu's last entry
 * pushes to. See the note above that entry for why both have to exist.
 *
 * The one thing this menu must not do is let you pick a machine that cannot
 * serve you. The account's cloud Computer can come back
 * status:"upgrade_required" / blockedReason:"plan_downgraded" — observed live —
 * and the session proxy then answers every request with a permanent 425. If
 * that row looks pickable, the app sends you to a spinner that never ends. So
 * a blocked machine is listed disabled, with its reason folded into the label
 * and, for blocks that are not about money, a way out to the web.
