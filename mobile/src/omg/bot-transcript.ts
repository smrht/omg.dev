/**
 * What of a bot's backing session the human is meant to read as a chat.
 *
 * A bot's session is a normal managed session (see the server's
 * `POST /api/bots/:id/messages`, src/commands/serve.ts), so its transcript
 * carries the same plumbing any session does — tool calls, tool results,
 * thinking blocks — plus one thing unique to a bot's FIRST turn: the launch
 * envelope the server folds in with the human's own opening line (bundling
 * them avoids a race between the agent's boot and a message sent right after
 * it — see the server route's own comment). A bot chat should read as talking
 * to somebody, not as a session log, so both get stripped here at the
 * rendering boundary — never in the message store itself, so the underlying
 * session is still a complete, honest transcript when opened as a session.
 *
 * Mirrors the web's web/src/lib/bot-transcript.ts in spirit (same envelope
 * strip, same hidden-kind set), narrower in scope: this branch's server does
 * not carry the prior-conversation-summary block, background-task reports, or
 * bot-to-bot peer messages the web strips, because this branch's minimal
 * `POST /api/bots/:id/messages` (see serve.ts's own note on it) does not
 * generate any of those. Extend this file, not that endpoint, once the
 * pending reconciliation lands the fuller bot stack.
