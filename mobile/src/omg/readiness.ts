/**
 * Is the Computer actually ready to answer, and if not, why?
 *
 * `GET /api/bootstrap` is the readiness authority for the whole surface — the
 * first call the client makes after it has a grant, and the one whose failure
 * mode decides which screen a person sees. The status codes are not
 * interchangeable and collapsing them into "error" is what turns a machine that
 * is merely cold into a machine that looks broken.
 *
 * 425 in particular is not a failure. A reaped sandbox hibernates and wakes on
 * connect; the proxy answers 425 while that is in flight and the only correct
 * client behaviour is to wait and ask again. Observed live on 2026-08-12
 * against a cold cloud Computer.
