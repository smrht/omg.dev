 * The two choices a new session needs besides the prompt: WHICH AGENT runs it,

 * POST /api/sessions/new so the box always picked its default, and `cwd` was
 * always the machine's `defaultFolder` — the composer printed that folder as a
 * caption but offered no way to change it. On a product whose whole premise is
 * "which agent, on which project", neither question could be answered from the
 * phone.
 *
 * Both live here together, in the same shape, deliberately. They are the same
 * kind of decision — a short list of alternatives, one currently selected —
 * and giving them one module means the selection rules (what is offered, what
 * happens when the roster is empty, how the current choice is marked) cannot
 * drift into two slightly different answers.
 *
 * Selections are per-machine and are NOT persisted. Agents are configured on
 * the box and folders exist on its disk, so a choice restored from storage
 * could easily name something the current machine does not have — which would
 * be a 400 at launch, discovered only after typing a prompt. The roster is the
 * only authority, so the default is derived from it every time.
