/**
 * The transcript, rendered per message KIND rather than as one stream of prose.
 *
 * The server emits five kinds into a session — `text`, `tool_use`,
 * `tool_result`, `image`, `thinking` — and the screen only ever knew about two
 * of them. Everything else fell through to the assistant branch and was printed
 * as body copy, which is how a phone ended up showing `(thinking)` as a
 * sentence and `mcp__omg__omg_run_auto_agent: { "id": "…" }` as a paragraph.
 * Every kind gets a renderer here, and anything unrecognised still lands on a
 * readable row instead of the empty box attachments used to draw.
 *
 * WHERE THE TOOL PAYLOAD LIVES. `OmgMessage` has no args/input/name-of-tool
 * field, because the server flattens the provider's structured block into the
 * one string it does have. src/sessions.ts (`describeInput`) writes a tool call
 * as `"<toolName>: " + JSON.stringify(input, null, 2)` and a tool result as the
 * result text alone. So the payload is `message.text`, and parsing it back is
 * this module's job — `parseToolCall` is the inverse of that server function.
 *
 * WHY THE ARGUMENTS ARE PARSED AND NOT PRINTED. `JSON.stringify` escapes the
 * newlines *inside* a string value, so a prompt-shaped argument arrives as one
 * enormous line containing literal `\n\n`. Printing `text` verbatim is the bug
 * this module exists to kill: JSON.parse restores the real newlines, and each
 * top-level argument is then handed to `CodeBlock` under its own name.
 *
 * WHY RESULTS ARE PAIRED BY ADJACENCY. The provider's `tool_use_id` does not
 * survive normalization, and neither does `is_error`. Message ids are
 * `<uuid>` / `<uuid>#<blockIndex>` scoped to the turn that carried the block,
 * and a result arrives under a *different* uuid than its call, so there is no
 * id relation to join on — inventing one would be a guess. What is reliable is
 * order: a lone call is immediately followed by its result. So a result is
 * attached only when exactly one call precedes it with no sibling call on
 * either side. A parallel batch (several calls, then several results, in an
 * order nothing here can recover) deliberately leaves them unpaired and shows
 * the results as their own rows rather than labelling one with another's name.
