/**
 * First-run onboarding: what a Computer is, once, before the session list.
 *
 * ── Why a gate and not a route ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This mirrors ai-consent.tsx exactly: a hook that reports "loading" |
 * "needed" | "done", and a full-screen component the layout RETURNS rather
 * than pushes. A route would be reachable by deep link and would need its own
 * guard to stop a signed-in user landing on it; a gate cannot be navigated to
 * at all. _layout.tsx already reads as a list of gates, and this is one more
 * in that list rather than a second mechanism beside it.
 *
 * It sits AFTER consent. Consent is a legal precondition for sending anything
 * anywhere, so it must come first; explaining the product to someone who then
 * declines consent and gets signed out would be wasted words.
 *
 * ── Paged, but never by swipe ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three panels, advanced by a button that is always on screen, with dots
 * showing how many are left. plan.tsx's header records the real mistake to
 * avoid: content hidden behind a gesture nobody is told about. A visible
 * Continue is not that. Swipe is deliberately NOT wired up, so there is
 * exactly one way forward and it is the one being pointed at.
 *
 * One idea per panel, because this is the first thing a new account sees and
 * a list of three bullets reads like a settings pane rather than a welcome.
 *
 * ── The copy is not invented ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every claim below is taken from the App Store description, which is the
 * product's own words:
 *
 *   "Run Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi on a dedicated cloud computer"
 *   "Your Computer keeps running after you close the app, with its files and
 *    sessions intact, so you can pick up later from the browser, over SSH, or
 *    back in the app."
 *   "Push notifications when an agent needs input or finishes a task"
 *
 * Do not add a point here that the description does not support. A first-run
 * screen that promises something the app does not do is the most expensive
 * place in the product to be wrong.

 * Every loop is skipped under Reduce Motion, which renders the resting state.

 *
