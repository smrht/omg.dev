/**
 * The sign-in drawer, over the prompt. IT SIGNS IN HERE.
 *
 * "Save your first task." is doing real work as a title: it says what signing
 * in is FOR at the only moment the person has something to lose. The prompt
 * stays visible behind it, dimmed, for the same reason.
 *
 * ── Dismissing returns to the prompt ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not to the task list, and not to a cleared editor. The close button and the
 * scrim both mean "not yet", and the text is owned above this component so
 * neither can drop it.
 *
 * ── No promise here ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The design had "Sign in to start. Your task is on us." and Benny removed the
 * second sentence. This is the last screen before an account exists and the
 * likeliest place for a claim to be read as a commitment, so it stays out.
 *
 * ── Apple and Google finish in this sheet ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * They used to hand the choice up and land on the full sign-in screen, so
 * tapping "Continue with Apple" produced a different screen with another
 * "Continue with Apple" on it. The bargain this flow makes is "write the task,
 * then sign in"; bouncing to a second screen to repeat the same tap breaks it.
 *
 * Email still hands up, and that is not an inconsistency: email is a code sent
 * and typed back, which needs a field, a keyboard and a second step. There is
 * nothing to do in place.
 *
 * ── The prompt is stashed BEFORE authenticating ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Signing in re-mounts the tree under this sheet, and Apple and Google both
 * leave the app entirely -- a system sheet or a browser, either of which can
 * be killed while somebody is over there. Anything still in component state at
 * that moment is gone. `onBeforeAuthenticate` is awaited first for exactly
 * that reason, so the words survive whatever happens next.
 *
 * Design: artboard "03 · Sign-in drawer · After prompt".
