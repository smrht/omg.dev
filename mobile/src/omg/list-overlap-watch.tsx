/**
 * A geometric trip-wire for a list, not a fix. The home list has carried one
 * since #149; the session transcript now does too, after Benny hit the same
 * shape there — a user bubble drawn over the tail of the reply above it.
 *
 * Benny has hit session/finding cards drawn on top of each other, with large
 * blank gaps elsewhere, on his real device — see the screenshot referenced in
 * the bug this file was added for. The content was always correct; only the
 * POSITIONS were wrong, which is the signature of a view left somewhere its
 * data no longer says it should be. `Row` wraps each top-level list item,
 * measures its own on-screen frame after every layout pass via
 * `measureInWindow` (window coordinates, so rows in different sections —
 * different parent Views — are still comparable), and a debounced check
 * sorts all currently-mounted rows by their MEASURED top (not document
 * order, which would need its own bookkeeping and isn't the thing that can
 * go wrong here) and flags any pair whose vertical ranges intersect.
 *
 * THIS FILE HAD A BUG, AND IT MATTERS WHO IT REACHED. The original
 * verification math was `prevBottom - curTop`, which silently assumes prev
 * is still above cur. A re-measurement does not guarantee that: if prev has
 * since settled somewhere well below cur, that formula turns a huge
 * SEPARATION into a huge fake OVERLAP. This shipped to Benny's device (the
 * real report that read "idle over recent, 57pt, 37 rows" is unverified —
 * it may be a genuine catch or it may be exactly this bug) before the fix
 * below existed. Fixed to the symmetric interval formula — `min(bottoms) -
 * max(tops)` — which is correct regardless of which row ends up on top the
 * second time.
 *
 * THE VERIFICATION ITSELF, added after a wave of suppressing every
 * Reanimated `entering`/`layout` animation on the list (see app/index.tsx)
 * still did not stop this from firing: a candidate hit schedules a SECOND,
 * independent `measureInWindow` pass on just the two offending rows after
 * `VERIFY_DELAY_MS`, and only reports if the SAME overlap survives. This is
 * what turned "two numbers that didn't match once" into "did this settle,"
 * and what proved — once the formula above was also fixed — that on this
 * simulator every candidate the detector has caught since has been a row
 * mid-relocation (typically an Auto row, moving 900-2000pt to its true
 * position), not a sustained overlap. That does not mean the bug is
 * imaginary — Benny's original screenshot, taken before this file existed,
 * is real, undebatable photographic evidence, and this simulator resolving
 * every candidate within `VERIFY_DELAY_MS` is consistent with the same
 * transient simply taking longer to settle on a loaded real device than on
 * a fast Mac. It means don't trust a raw "overlap found" line from before
 * this fix, on this device or his, as a confirmed finding on its own.
 *
 * A VERIFIED hit is real, but on its own it still can't tell apart the two
 * live theories for WHY: (a) one section mounted a large batch of new rows
 * in one commit and an early row measured before the batch finished, or (b)
 * two independently-timed data sources (sessions vs. auto findings vs.
 * resumable) changed close enough together to race each other. Both predict
 * a verified overlap; they don't predict the same SHAPE of one. So a
 * confirmed hit's payload also carries `diagnostics`: which sections had any
 * row report in the `ACTIVITY_WINDOW_MS` before the hit, how many rows in
 * each were mounting for the first time, and how long the screen had been up
 * — a big new-mount count in ONE section supports (a); meaningful activity
 * in TWO sections at once supports (b); and time-since-mount says whether
 * this is cold-load-adjacent or recurs well into a session. This turns the
 * next real hit into a tiebreaker instead of just more confirmation.
 *
 * On a hit: a console.error, unconditionally — harmless in a production
 * build with nobody attached to Metro, and free evidence the moment anyone
 * ever is. The TOAST is separate and deliberately gated: this is a
 * diagnostic for one bug report, not a feature, and a red "internal error"
 * toast firing on some unrelated user's phone for a transient, self-
 * correcting layout race would be a worse experience than the bug it is
 * trying to catch. `notifyUser` decides whether the toast fires; callers
 * should pass it only for the account that reported this (see
 * `app/index.tsx`), or `__DEV__`, never unconditionally for everyone on the
 * production channel.
 *
 * Fires at most once per screen mount, ONCE VERIFIED — this is a smoke
 * detector, not a running log, and a list that is actually broken will have
 * plenty of other evidence once this alarm has gone off once. An unverified
 * candidate that fails its re-check logs a `console.warn` and the check
 * keeps running — a later, genuine hit is still caught.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wired into SessionCard/AutoFindingCard themselves: `Row`
 * is a plain, un-animated `View` wrapped one level OUTSIDE those components,
 * so it cannot change anything about their own Reanimated `entering`/`layout`
 * behaviour — it can only ever observe the frame Yoga already computed.
