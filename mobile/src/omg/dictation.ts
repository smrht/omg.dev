/**
 * Dictation: hold the mic, speak, get text in the composer — live, not just
 * at the end.
 *
 * THE FINAL TRANSCRIPT STILL HAPPENS ON THE COMPUTER, not on the phone. What
 * changed from the file-only version of this hook: the machine's realtime
 * bridge at `/api/voice/stt-stream` (the same websocket the web composer's
 * dictation speaks — see lfg-serve's src/voice-providers.ts, "Streaming-STT
 * bridge") now gets 16 kHz mono PCM16 frames as we capture them, and streams
 * partial/final transcripts back while you're still talking. The whole-file
 * POST to `/api/voice/stt` survives as the fallback for a box with no
 * realtime provider configured (no ElevenLabs key) or a socket that drops —
 * see stop() below.
 *
 * WHY @siteed/audio-studio AND NOT expo-audio: expo-audio records to a file
 * and never hands JS a buffer — fine for the old whole-file path, useless for
 * streaming. Two candidates were evaluated to replace it:
 *   - expo-audio-stream (RubricLab): last published 2024-09-30, stalled at
 *     0.1.13. No release in the time this app has existed. Rejected — a
 *     realtime feature is exactly the wrong place to depend on something
 *     abandoned; the day it breaks against a future SDK bump, it breaks a
 *     feature that only works while recording, which is the hardest kind of
 *     regression to notice in review.
 *   - @siteed/expo-audio-studio: this used to be the name, but the package is
 *     now a deprecated re-export shim; the real package is
 *     @siteed/audio-studio (github.com/deeeed/audiolab), releases through
 *     2026-06-20, built on ExpoModulesCore (New Architecture by default since
 *     SDK 53, which is what this app is already on) and ships an
 *     `onAudioStream` callback that hands raw PCM16 while a WAV file is
 *     STILL being written to disk at the same time. That dual output is why
 *     one recording session now serves both this hook's paths: the same take
 *     that streams live also lands a file, so a socket failure mid-recording
 *     falls back to a real, complete recording rather than nothing.
 *
 * WAV, 16 kHz, mono, 16-bit — unchanged from before. It is what the batch
 * endpoint's contract asks for and what its streaming sibling already
 * speaks, so no format negotiation exists on either path.
 *
 * AVAudioSession is audio-studio's problem now, not this file's. expo-audio
 * left the session in a playback category until told otherwise (a whole
 * paragraph used to live here about the mic button silently doing nothing
 * because of it) — audio-studio sets `.playAndRecord` on start and
 * deactivates on stop internally, so there is no manual mode dance to get
 * wrong here.
