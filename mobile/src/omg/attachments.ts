/**
 * Files the user hands the agent.
 *
 * ATTACHMENTS TRAVEL AS TEXT, and that is not a shortcut — it is the contract
 * the whole product already speaks. The bytes are uploaded to the COMPUTER,
 * which writes them into its uploads dir and hands back an absolute path; the
 * message then carries that path in a trailing block:
 *
 *     Attached files:
 *     - IMG_0850.png: /tmp/lfg-uploads/…-IMG_0850.png
 *
 * Coding agents read local files, so the path IS the delivery mechanism.
 * `composeAttachmentMessage` in web/src/App.tsx builds the identical block, and
 * web/src/lib/message-attachments.ts parses it back off for display — diverge
 * here by a character and the same message renders as a path on one surface and
 * a picture on the other.
 *
 * The upload goes through `client.transport`, never a bare fetch: the transport
 * owns the grant, its refresh, and the base URL of whichever computer is
 * selected. A hand-rolled fetch would have to re-derive all three and would
 * silently target the wrong machine after a switch.
