   * screen mounts, then never again.
   *
   * Both caught overlaps were on cold load, and both are consistent with the
   * same race: Working/Idle rows come from `sessions` (client.listSessions())
   * while Auto rows come from a SEPARATE fetch (useAutoAgents(), see above) —
   * two independent sources that do not resolve on the same tick. Cold load
   * is the one moment potentially dozens of rows across BOTH sources mount
   * and start their own `entering: FadeInDown` within the same beat; the
   * measured cross-row position corruption showed up between rows in
   * DIFFERENT sections (idle vs. auto) and rows in the SAME section
   * (recent vs. recent), which is what an entering-animation race predicts
   * and a single stranded-view bug would not.
   *
   * `layout` ALSO SUPPRESSED, not just `entering` — first attempt left
   * `layout: LinearTransition` live and still measured 1 overlap in 5 cold
   * loads. Either source can straggle in across more than one wave (a
   * session's subagent children resolving after its own row, a finding's
   * `occurrences` bumping mid-load), and a `layout` reflow racing a sibling
   * that is itself still settling is the same class of race `entering` is —
   * animating FROM or TO a frame that is about to move again is exactly how
   * a transiently-wrong position gets painted. During the window a row
   * SNAPS directly to its current correct position with no animation,
   * rather than risk animating relative to one.
   *
   * A FIXED WINDOW since mount, not an "is any section still empty" check,
   * deliberately — the two sources resolving at different times is exactly

   * away with less. list-overlap-watch.tsx is what would tell you which:

  /**
   * WHY AUTO CAN PAINT BEFORE THE SESSION LIST, AND WHY THAT IS THE BUG.
   *
   * `load()` above gates on `ready` — the machine's own wake/probe round
   * trip has to finish before it even ATTEMPTS `client.listSessions()`.
   * `useAutoAgents()` (above) gates its own fetch on nothing but the API
   * client existing — no readiness check — so on a machine that needs
   * waking, Auto's request is already in flight, and often already
   * answered, while Sessions hasn't started yet. The result: on the first
   * render where `ready` flips true, Auto can already have rows to show
   * while the folder groups are still empty — and then Sessions resolves a
   * beat later and mounts a batch of rows ABOVE Auto, shoving it down
   * mid-settle. list-overlap-watch.tsx
   * caught this live, twice identically: Idle mounting late while Auto had
   * already-settled rows re-measuring, not newly mounting ones.
   *
   * THE FIX: Auto and Recent do not render their rows until Sessions has
   * had its own turn — `sessionsSettled`, set above once `load()` resolves
   * (success OR failure both count; see that flag's doc comment). This
   * removes the ordering bug directly — nothing above a section can shove
   * it late if the section waits for everything above it — rather than
   * papering over its consequences with animation suppression, which
   * #150 already tried and which did not hold up under real-device
   * evidence.
   *
   * THE TIMEOUT IS WHAT MAKES THIS SAFE. `sessionsSettled` becoming true
   * depends on `load()` actually running to completion, and `load()`
   * refuses to run at all while `!ready` — so a machine that never finishes
   * waking, or a `listSessions()` call that hangs, would leave Auto and
   * Recent hidden FOREVER without this. `SESSIONS_SETTLE_TIMEOUT_MS` forces
   * `sessionsSettled` true regardless once it elapses, trading one
   * old-fashioned reflow (Auto/Recent appearing, then Sessions arriving
   * even later and pushing them down the ORIGINAL way) for never blocking
   * indefinitely. 2500ms is a guess, not a measurement, sized as "longer
   * than a `listSessions()` call should ever reasonably take once the
   * machine is confirmed awake" — this hook only starts counting once
   * `ready` is true, so it is not timing the wake itself, only the session
   * fetch that follows it. Tunable the same way COLD_LOAD_WINDOW_MS was —
   * list-overlap-watch.tsx would show it if this needs to move.

            it would be ceremony; the rows simply live at the bottom of the one
            that is there, under a hairline, the way a sidebar footer does.

            IT SCROLLS ITSELF AND IT IS CAPPED. Five rows plus the machine is
            ~280pt, which is most of the column in a short window (a landscape
            split, a small stage). The cap keeps the session list the larger
            half and lets the nav scroll inside whatever it is given, rather
            than pushing the list off its own rail. */}
