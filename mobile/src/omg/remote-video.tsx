/**
 * A video whose bytes sit behind the transport's grant.
 *
 * The same problem `remote-image.tsx` solves, with a different answer.
 *
 * Every URL on a Computer is served by the session proxy behind
 * `Authorization: Bearer <grant>`, and a native player issues its own request.
 * expo-video CAN carry headers on a source, and that was the obvious route,
 * but the grant is deliberately short-lived and the transport deliberately
 * exposes no URL for exactly this reason -- `assetUrl` returns null and says
 * so. Handing a player a token to replay for the length of a video means
 * re-implementing refresh, and a token that expires mid-playback stalls the
 * picture with nothing to show for it.
 *
 * So the bytes come down through `client.transport.fetch`, which already owns
 * the grant, its refresh and the 401 retry, and are written to a file. The
 * player is then pointed at a local path and carries no auth at all. This is
 * also what the web does -- see AuthenticatedArtifactVideo, which pulls the
 * whole blob before the `<video>` exists -- so both surfaces behave the same.
 *
 * ── The modules are required lazily, and that is load-bearing ─────────────
 *
 * expo-video and expo-file-system are NATIVE. They cannot ship over the air,
 * so every build made before they were added -- including one somebody is
 * running right now -- does not have them. A static import would crash that
 * app at module load, taking the whole transcript with it. Required lazily,
 * a missing module degrades to the same honest card the app showed before
 * video had a renderer at all.
