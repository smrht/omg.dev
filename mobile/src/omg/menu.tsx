/**
 * A menu that hangs off the control you pressed — the system's own, not a sheet
 * that flies up from the bottom of the screen.
 *
 * Every "pick one of these" in this app used to be a UIAlertController via
 * `ActionSheetIOS`. That is the right control for a short list of ACTIONS whose
 * consequences are worth a beat of ceremony, and the wrong one for a SELECTION:
 * which agent runs, which folder it runs in, which computer to talk to. A sheet
 * takes the whole bottom of the screen, dims everything behind it, animates in
 * and out, and appears nowhere near the thing it belongs to — for changing
 * "Claude" to "Codex". iOS answers that question with a menu anchored to the
 * control, and every system app (Files' sort, Safari's tabs, Photos' add) uses
 * one.
 *
 * That difference is not skin-deep: a menu draws a REAL checkmark against the
 * current choice, so the answer and the alternatives are one list. The sheet
 * could not, which is why the old call sites prefixed labels with a literal
 * "✓ " — a checkmark impersonation, at the wrong size, in the wrong place,
 * indenting nothing.
 *
 * SwiftUI's `Menu` through `@expo/ui`, which is already in the tree as an
 * expo-router dependency — so this needs no new native module and no rebuild.
 * The one thing callers must adapt to is that it is DECLARATIVE: the menu wraps
 * its trigger rather than being opened from an onPress. There is no `open()` to
 * call, and iOS exposes no way to open one programmatically, so a control that
 * offers a menu renders the menu AROUND itself. That is why the picker hooks in
 * this app hand back OPTIONS instead of a callback.

     * report. Forced `option.image` onto this trigger's label (bypassing
     * this guard) with the full 6-row agent roster open behind it — the
     * mark rendered natively at its asset's own pixel size, a slab several
     * hundred points wide overlapping the header text, the row list below
