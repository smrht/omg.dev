/**
 * Turning the onboarding answer into a real session, once there is an account.
 *
 * This is the join between the two halves of the revamp: step 03 collects a
 * prompt before sign-in, and this runs it after. Without it the flow is a
 * questionnaire.
 *
 * ── It runs once, and only for a genuinely new arrival ────────────────────
 *
 * takeOnboardingChoice() reads and clears, so a failure here does not leave a
 * prompt lying around to ambush a later launch. The hour ceiling in that
 * module is the other half of the same guarantee.
 *
 * ── Everything it needs may not be ready at once ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Signing in resolves an account, a Computer and a live client at different
 * moments. Asking before they exist is the ordinary case, not an error, so the
 * caller polls this and it simply reports "not yet" until it can act.
