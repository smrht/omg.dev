/**
 * Lucide glyphs, drawn from the icon FONT rather than from SVG.
 *
 * Every other glyph in this app is an SF Symbol, and that stays true — they
 * carry the system's optical weights and match the bar, the keyboard and the
 * menus for free. Lucide is here for the handful of places where the SF
 * Symbols catalogue has no honest equivalent: `desktopcomputer` is a Mac,
 * `pc` is a tower, and neither means "the machine this app is talking to".
 *
 * WHY A FONT AND NOT `lucide-react-native`.
 *
 * The React package renders through `react-native-svg`, which is a native
 * module. This app runs on a prebuilt dev client (and a TestFlight binary),
 * so adding a native module means an EAS rebuild and a reinstall on every
 * device before a single icon appears. The font ships the same 2045 glyphs as
 * an ordinary asset, loads at runtime, and needs no native code at all.
 *
 * The whole font is committed (~834K) rather than a subset of the two icons
 * used today. A subset would need regenerating every time someone reaches for
 * a third icon, and the failure mode when they forget is a tofu box on screen
 * — a bug that looks like a rendering problem rather than a missing build
 * step. Any name in `LUCIDE` below just works.
 *
 * Adding an icon: look its codepoint up in lucide-static's
 * `font/codepoints.json` (`npm pack lucide-static`) and add it to `LUCIDE`.
 * The map is deliberately small and explicit — a `Record<string, number>` of
 * all 2045 would let a typo compile.
