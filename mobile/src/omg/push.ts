/**
 * Native push notifications (APNs, reached through Expo's push relay).
 *
 * The web app's Web Push stack (see the machine's src/push.ts) doesn't apply
 * here: there is no service worker, no PushManager, no browser origin to hold
 * a subscription against. `expo-notifications` is the native equivalent —
 * it mints an Expo push token, the machine hands that token to Expo's push
 * API, and Expo forwards it to APNs using the project's own APNs key.
 *
 * WHEN THIS ASKS FOR PERMISSION: never on its own, and never at first launch.
 * `registerForPushNotifications` is inert until something calls it — wired to
 * the "Notifications" toggle in Settings, an explicit action taken after the
 * person has already seen the app do something. Asking at first launch (the
 * thing this file deliberately does NOT do) is the single biggest reason
 * people permanently deny a permission prompt: they have no context yet for
 * what they'd be saying yes to, and iOS does not let you ask again once
 * denied — only Settings.app can undo that. A first-run prompt trades a
 * one-time possible "yes" for a permanent, unrecoverable "no" from anyone who
 * was startled by it. Settings is also where the equivalent Web Push toggle
 * already lives on the dashboard, so this keeps the mental model identical
 * across surfaces rather than inventing a second place to turn it on.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: run in the background to fetch anything. The web
 * design's payload-less path relies on a service worker calling back to
 * /api/push/pending on every wake; there is no native equivalent of that
 * without a Notification Service Extension (a second Xcode target — the same
 * category of native-build work the Live Activity widget needs, and just as
 * out of scope for this phase). So the machine sends the real title/body
 * straight to Expo, and this file's job ends at registering the token and
 * routing a tap. See push-native.ts on the machine for the fuller rationale.
 *
 * DEGRADES HONESTLY: no EAS project id, no physical device (simulators have
 * no APNs identity), permission denied, or the machine unreachable all fail
 * into `registerForPushNotifications` returning a reason instead of throwing
 * — the caller decides what to show, and the app is exactly as usable as
 * before someone tapped the toggle.

/**
 * Wire notification taps to in-app navigation. Mount ONCE, near the root —
 * this app's `_layout.tsx` is on the do-not-touch list for this change, so it
 * is not wired in here. The exact diff to apply there ships alongside this
 * file; the shape is: import `useNotificationTapRouting` and call it inside
 * `RootNavigator`, unconditionally (rules of hooks) near its existing
 * `const { authStatus } = useOmg()`, passing `authStatus === "signed-in"`.
 *
 * `ready` gates the actual navigation, not the hook call: a cold start that
 * launches straight from a notification tap delivers the tap before
 * `RootNavigator` has anything signed-in to show — `authStatus` is "loading"
 * for the first frames, and the branch above the signed-in Stack renders
 * `<Splash/>` with no Stack mounted at all yet. Pushing into a route nothing
 * is listening for yet is exactly the kind of race only a device proves either
 * way, so this waits for the caller to say the Stack is actually up rather
 * than assuming expo-router queues navigation correctly against an unmounted
 * tree. The response itself isn't lost by waiting: `useLastNotificationResponse`
 * holds onto it until `clearLastNotificationResponse` is called, which the
 * effect below does only once it has actually handled the tap, so the effect
 * re-runs and fires as soon as `ready` flips true.
 *
 * The machine sends `data.url` as an app-relative path it already resolved
 * from a web-style notification url (see push-native.ts's toNativeAppUrl) —
 * e.g. "/session/<id>" or "/notifications" — so this only ever pushes a path
 * this app's own router already understands, the same routes `omg://` deep
 * links resolve to.
