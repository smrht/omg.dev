/**
 * Auto agents — the ones that run on a timer instead of because you asked.
 *
 * An auto agent is JUST a prompt plus a cron schedule (see src/auto/store.ts).
 * It is NOT a session on its own: it has no transcript, nothing to resume.
 * What it produces is a FINDING — one notification, at most, per run,
 * carrying its reasoning and a lifecycle (open, dismissed, or graduated into
 * a real session). That distinction is the whole reason these get their own
 * section on the home screen rather than being folded into Working/Idle,
 * where tapping a row opens a transcript and swiping one archives a session —
 * here tapping (then "Start session") launches a NEW session seeded from the
 * finding, and swiping dismisses the finding, not a session that never
 * existed. See selectHomeAutoFindings and setFindingStatus below, and
 * startSessionFromFinding in app/index.tsx.
 *
 * WHAT THE HOME SCREEN IS FOR, AND WHY THIS LIST IS A FINDINGS LIST.
 *
 * This box can have dozens of auto agents. Rendering that roster would put
 * a wall of configuration under the three sections that show live work,
 * which is the opposite of what the screen is for — and it is not what the
 * web does either: the web keeps the full roster on a MANAGEMENT page
 * (/settings/computer/auto, titled "Schedules") and its live view shows only
 * open findings, one row each, agent-grouping and all (see the "Auto"
 * section in web/src/App.tsx). The phone has no management page, so this
 * mirrors the live view exactly rather than inventing a phone-only shape: the
 * home section shows one row per open finding, nothing about the quiet
 * agents that produced none. See selectHomeAutoFindings.
 *
 * Both reads degrade to nothing rather than to an error, the same way
 * resumable.ts does: an older machine has no /api/auto/* at all, and someone
 * who opened this screen to see what needs attention should not be told
 * about it. They degrade INDEPENDENTLY, too — a machine that can list
 * findings but not agents still owes you the findings, with a generic mark
 * where the agent's name and avatar would be (see AutoFindingRow).
