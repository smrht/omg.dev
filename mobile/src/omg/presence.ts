/**
 * Keeps a cloud Computer out of its inactivity pause while someone is using it.
 *
 * The control plane splits reading state from expressing lifecycle demand:
 * authorizeCloudComputerSession is documented "mint/refresh traffic never
 * provisions, wakes, or extends a Computer", and probe() already owns the WAKE
 * half of that. Presence is the KEEP-AWAKE half — a renewable lease keyed by
 * (computerId, leaseId) whose expiry is the only thing standing between an
 * active session and the disconnect grace period (45s on the base plan). The
 * web dashboard renews one on an interval; an app that sends none watches its
 * Computer pause mid-session, which is the bug this module exists to fix.
 *
 * The protocol's one sharp edge: per leaseId, eventSeq must STRICTLY increase,
 * and a renew or release whose seq is not ahead of the stored one is answered
 * { stale: true } and ignored entirely. A counter that restarts at 1 on app
 * launch is a permanent, silent failure against a live lease. So the sequence
 * is derived from the wall clock — Date.now() cannot replay an old value
 * against a lease that has seen a newer one — with a persisted + in-memory
 * ratchet layered on top, because the clock alone can be set backwards and the
 * persisted value alone depends on a write landing. Each issued seq is the max
 * of the two guards, so going backwards requires both to fail at once.
 *
 * The seq space is scoped to the lease id, which is why a wiped AsyncStorage
 * is still safe: a fresh random lease id has no server-side lease to be stale
 * against, so starting its sequence over is harmless.
