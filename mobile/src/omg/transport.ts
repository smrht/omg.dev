/**
 * Building an OmgTransport for a phone.
 *
 * Everything the web dashboard does to reach a Computer is reused here rather
 * than reimplemented: `createGrantTransport` from @omg-dev/client already
 * attaches `Authorization: Bearer <grant>`, retries once on 401 with
 * forceRefresh, and opens the live socket with the `lfg-bearer.<grant>`
 * subprotocol. It takes injectable `fetch`/`WebSocket` and depends on nothing
 * from the DOM, so it runs unmodified on React Native.
 *
 * What this file adds is the part the dashboard keeps in host code: minting the
 * grant, and owning exactly one grant + one transport per binding.
