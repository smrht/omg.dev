           * MEASURED, 2026-08-14, iPhone 17 Pro sim (iOS 26.0), dark

           * `headerBlurEffect` + a page-colour View behind the navigator — and

           *
           *  1. Wrapper View painted red, `contentStyle` semi-transparent
           *     green. NO red was visible anywhere. The screen's content view
           *     covers the wrapper completely, so "paint the page behind the
           *     navigator" buys nothing; the page colour simply stops being
           *     drawn and the light system material shows through instead.
