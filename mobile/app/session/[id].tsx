/**
 * A session: the transcript, and the composer.
 *
 * All the hard live-stream work belongs to @omg-dev/client, not to this file.
 * `live.subscribeTranscript` owns the socket, the reconnect backoff, the resume
 * cursor and the multiplexing, and hands back a small event union. The
 * prototype hand-rolled its own WebSocket with a fixed 1500ms retry and no
 * resume; using the SDK instead means this screen gets the same semantics the
 * web surface has, and keeps getting them when the protocol moves.
 *
 * Streaming detail worth knowing: an in-flight assistant turn arrives as
 * `ai_part` deltas, NOT as messages. They accumulate into a synthetic trailing
 * element which is replaced the moment the real `message` lands — otherwise
 * the finished turn renders twice.
 *
 * Layout mirrors the web Computer session view: only the USER's message is a
 * card (with a copy affordance underneath); the assistant's reply is plain
 * text on the page background.
 *
 * How a message becomes a row is NOT this file's problem — src/omg/transcript
 * owns that, one renderer per message kind, and `buildTranscriptItems` is what
 * turns the flat message array into what the list draws. This screen is the
 * live stream and the composer.
 *
 * Every glyph on this screen is an SF Symbol via `Icon`/`IconButton`. It used
 * to draw its own chevrons, paperclip, mic and pause out of rotated Views —
 * ~190 lines of geometry that could never match the system's optical weights,
 * and looked hand-made next to any real iOS app. The overflow and the prompt
 * history are system menus anchored to their buttons (see src/omg/menu.tsx),
 * not sheets thrown up from the bottom of the screen.
 *
 * The bar is the system's, not ours. It used to be drawn in-screen because
 * KeyboardAvoidingView measures against its PARENT, so a native header would
 * have needed its height fed back as `keyboardVerticalOffset`, and
 * `useHeaderHeight` lives in @react-navigation/elements, which this app does
 * not depend on. Moving the keyboard to `useAnimatedKeyboard` removed that
 * constraint — the lift is driven by the real keyboard frame and does not
 * care what sits above it — so this screen now gets a real UINavigationBar:
 * the system back chevron and edge-swipe come free, the title truncates the
 * way UIKit truncates, and the bar grows its own hairline once the transcript
 * scrolls under it. The avatar stays in the title (small, beside the text)
 * because it is the only place the agent's identity appears on this screen,
 * and Messages puts the participant's face in exactly that spot. No large
 * title: a session title is a long prompt, not a section name, and the
 * transcript is what should dominate the screen.

   * height, and clamping at 0 keeps the resting state untouched.
