/**
 * Account management that lives on the web. NOT billing — see below.
 *
 * NO PURCHASE LINKS IN THIS APP. There used to be a "Plan & billing" row here
 * opening `app.omg.dev/settings/billing`, and it has to stay gone until omg
 * sells through StoreKit.
 *
 * App Review Guideline 3.1.1(a): "In all other storefronts, except for the
 * United States storefront, where this prohibition does not apply, apps and
 * their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to
 * action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app
 * purchase." omg ships outside the US, so the exception does not cover us and
 * this row was the clearest possible example of the thing it prohibits.
 *
 * The rows that remain are account MANAGEMENT — which agents are connected,
 * what is scheduled, how much disk is used. None of them is a way to pay, and
 * 3.1.1 is aimed at purchasing, not at a companion app linking to its own
 * dashboard.
 *
 * The upgrade nudge is not lost, it MOVED. 3.1.3: "Developers can send
 * communications outside of the app to their user base about purchasing
 * methods other than in-app purchase." So running out of included time is
 * stated as a fact in the app and followed up by email, which is allowed in
 * every storefront.
 *
 * STOREKIT HAS NOW LANDED, and the honest fix arrived as predicted: the
 * "Subscription and plan" row in the Computer card pushes app/plan.tsx, an
 * in-app purchase. The web link did NOT come back and must not — an in-app
 * paywall that also offers an external checkout is the same 3.1.1(a) violation
 * with an extra step.
 *
 * THE ROW IS NAMED FOR THE REVIEWER, NOT FOR US. It read "Plan", under a
 * heading reading "Computer", and App Review rejected 1.0 (34) under guideline
 * 2.1(b) saying they "cannot locate the In-App Purchases within the app".
 * Nothing on the path to the paywall contained the word subscription. Someone
 * hunting for in-app purchases had no reason to open a row called Plan. Do not
 * rename this back to something shorter.
 */
/**
 * Legal documents, on omg.dev rather than app.omg.dev.
 *
 * Guideline 5.1.1(i): "All apps must include a link to their privacy policy in
 * the App Store Connect metadata field AND within the app in an easily
 * accessible manner." The metadata half was already set; the in-app half was
 * simply absent — this app shipped with no privacy link anywhere in the binary,
 * which applies to every app and always has, not just subscription ones.
 *
 * These are a separate constant from WEB_PAGES on purpose. WEB_PAGES are
 * dashboard surfaces, sit under "These open omg.dev in your browser", and point
 * at app.omg.dev. These point at the PUBLIC site, because a reviewer has to be
 * able to open them while signed out — behind a dashboard login they would not
 * be "easily accessible" and arguably not accessible at all.
 *
 * Not a 3.1.1(a) concern: a legal document is not a purchasing mechanism. See
 * the account-deletion comment above for the full argument; the same reasoning
 * covers both, and Guideline 5.1.1(i) requires this one outright.
