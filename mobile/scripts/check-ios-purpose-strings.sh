# WHY THIS EXISTS. Build 34 shipped
# "Allow $(PRODUCT_NAME) to access your microphone" and was rejected under
# guideline 5.1.1(ii) -- twice. app.json held a long, specific string the
# whole time. The @siteed/audio-studio config plugin overwrites
# NSMicrophoneUsageDescription with its own default, because the value from
# `ios.infoPlist` is not yet in modResults when that plugin's mod runs. Reading
# app.json therefore proves nothing. Only the prebuild output does.
#
# Runs prebuild in a THROWAWAY COPY. A leftover `ios/` directory in the real
# tree would flip EAS to the bare workflow and ignore app.json entirely.
