/**
 * Build the iOS app on bennys-macbook-pro-2 instead of on EAS Build.
 *
 * ── Why ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `mobile-release.yml` runs `eas build` on a GitHub runner, which bills an
 * EAS build (iOS medium, about $2) per attempt. Four attempts on 2026-09-23
 * cost roughly $8, and two of them failed for toolchain reasons rather than
 * anything in the app. The Mac already has Xcode, CocoaPods, fastlane and
 * the signing credentials, so `eas build --local` produces the SAME signed
 * IPA there for nothing.
 *
 * The cloud path stays. It is the one that works when the Mac is asleep, off
 * the tailnet, or busy with the e2e suite. This is the cheap path, not the
 * replacement.
 *
 * ── Three things that are NOT optional ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each of these cost a failed build to find, and each fails in a way that
 * blames something else entirely.
 *
 * 1. A GIT CLONE, NOT AN RSYNC. `eas build --local` archives from the git
 *    root. `metro.config.js` watches `../packages/protocol/src`, which is
 *    OUTSIDE mobile/, so a project-directory-only copy loses it. Metro then
 *    fails to build its Transformer, and react/metro#1808 swallows the real
 *    error and reports `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
 *    'transformFile')` instead. Nothing in that message points at the cause.
 *
 * 2. A PRIVATE TMPDIR, OUTSIDE THE CLONE, WITH THE METRO CACHE WIPED EACH RUN.
 *    `computer-control-dom.tsx` is a `use dom` component, and the transformer
 *    generates its entry with an ABSOLUTE path baked in. Metro caches that
 *    entry under $TMPDIR, so the path outlives the directory it names.
 *
 *    Isolating $TMPDIR is necessary but NOT sufficient, which cost a build to
 *    learn. Sharing the default $TMPDIR pulled in
 *    `~/.omg-e2e-src/.../computer-control-dom.tsx` from the e2e tree. Using a
 *    private one then pulled in `<previous-build-uuid>/build/mobile/src/...`,
 *    because eas-build-local uses a fresh UUID directory per run and the
 *    cached entry still pointed at the last one. So the cache is deleted
 *    before every build.
 *
 *    It must also not live inside the clone, or EAS refuses outright with
 *    "cannot copy <dir> to a subdirectory of self".
 *
 * 3. DEVELOPER_DIR, NOT xcode-select. Xcode 27 sits beside 26.6 and only 26.6
 *    is selected, because the e2e suite and every proven build run on it.
 *    Switching the system default to try 27 would put that at risk for every
 *    other agent on the box.
 *
 * ── Usage ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   bun run scripts/mac-build.ts                      # main, Xcode 27, no submit
 *   bun run scripts/mac-build.ts --ref my-branch
 *   bun run scripts/mac-build.ts --xcode 26           # the proven toolchain
 *   bun run scripts/mac-build.ts --submit             # upload to App Store Connect
 *   bun run scripts/mac-build.ts --profile preview
