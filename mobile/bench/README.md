# Native transcript benchmark

This standalone entry renders the product TranscriptRow and Markdown components.
It has no login or network data dependency. It is not reachable from the product
entry. Run it with an installed omg development client that supports RN 0.86.2.

From mobile/:

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
TRANSCRIPT_PERF_OUTPUT=/tmp/transcript-perf.jsonl bun scripts/benchmark-transcript.ts --production
```

The runner starts Metro on 127.0.0.1:8096 and a result collector on
127.0.0.1:8098. It temporarily selects the benchmark entry in package.json and
restores the product entry on exit. Do not run two copies in one checkout.
Omit --production for a development run with React Profiler measurements.

Forward both ports to the Mac, then open the client on a specific simulator:

```sh
ssh -N -R 8096:127.0.0.1:8096 -R 8098:127.0.0.1:8098 bennykok@bennys-macbook-pro-2
# In another terminal, substitute your chosen simulator UDID:
ssh bennykok@bennys-macbook-pro-2 "xcrun simctl terminate UDID dev.omg.computer; xcrun simctl openurl UDID 'omg://expo-development-client/?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8096'"
```

The benchmark runs six trials in ABBAAB order. Each uses the same 40 rows,
initial render count, padding, and four linear native scroll legs over 16 seconds.
A 50ms timer updates the streaming tail. Baseline uses the original Markdown
path and ordinary state updates. Optimized uses memoized VirtualView bodies and
transition updates. Both rebuild item wrappers when the draft changes.

Results are appended as JSONL. JS requestAnimationFrame intervals measure JS
responsiveness, not display FPS. updatesReceived counts timer callbacks served;
it is not a network throughput measurement. React render duration is available
only in development. UI callback intervals come from Reanimated. Check their
sample coverage against wall time before interpreting them as display timing.
mountAndWarmupMs includes a five-second warmup; it is not startup latency.

--production uses minified production JavaScript inside a development native
client. It is not a store release or a physical-device benchmark. Simulator
results do not establish a 120Hz guarantee, battery gain, or memory gain.

After the trials, an inspection screen shows the real rows. Open and dismiss the tool sheet, then
expand the first user message. Scroll to Bottom, then Top. Check expansion state,
row positions, and the Resize control. Capture screenshots before and after.
Stop the runner and the SSH forward when done. Restore the simulator's normal
client entry if it was in use before the benchmark.

Focused behavior checks (from the repository root, after root and mobile installs):

```sh
bun test ./mobile/scripts/transcript-body.native-check.tsx
TRANSCRIPT_FALLBACK=web bun test ./mobile/scripts/transcript-body.native-check.tsx
TRANSCRIPT_FALLBACK=old-client bun test ./mobile/scripts/transcript-body.native-check.tsx
```

These use the shared DOM harness and a native visibility-event mock. They check
memoization, restoration of updated hidden content, the lifetime of the surrounding
row, and fallback rendering. They do not substitute for the simulator checks.
The checks are opt-in so the default runtime test suite does not require the
separate mobile dependency install.
