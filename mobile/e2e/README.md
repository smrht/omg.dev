# E2E for the omg iOS client: Jev plans and Maestro flows

Run with `bun run test:e2e` from `mobile/`. The runner is
`../scripts/maestro.ts`. It resolves the simulator UDID by name and takes a
lock on the shared Mac.

## Plans (the default)

```bash
bun run test:e2e --plan onboarding --record
bun run test:e2e --build --plan onboarding --record
bun run test:e2e --install <EAS tar.gz url or .app path> --plan onboarding --record
```

`<name>.plan.json` is a list of steps. Each step has a `goal` and a `done`
description in plain words; Jev (TypeSafe) reads the accessibility tree and
decides whether the step is done, whether the screen is a dead end, and what
to tap next. `expect` and `forbid` are exact strings checked in code: that is
where a feature proof lives. `selected` names a row that must report
selected (a lane, a task). `type` types text (`${EMAIL}` is substituted),
`otp: true` types the sign-in code the runner reads from Gmail, `focused: true`
skips the tap. `timeoutMs` is the ceiling per step (default 60s).

`--record` writes `<name>.mp4` here: device on the left, the step list on the
right ticking green or red as the runner decides. The raw capture is next to
it as `<name>-capture.mp4`. Both are gitignored.

Each onboarding run signs up a new plus-alias of `OMG_E2E_MAILBOX` (default
`itechbenny@gmail.com`) and provisions a new hosted Computer. Nothing removes
them: account deletion finishes in the browser. Expect the accounts to pile up.

Those addresses are on the auth service's trusted-sender list
(`vibes/apps/auth/src/trusted-senders.ts`), so repeated runs from the one
Mac are not blocked by the per-IP limit or the Turnstile check. The only cap
is 30 codes an hour and 200 a day across all runs. Change the address shape,
and you must change that list too.

Plans need a release build, not the dev client: `launchApp` with `clearState`
is what puts every run at step 01. `--build` makes one with Xcode on the Mac
(`scripts/e2e-build.ts`), about 45 seconds when the native project is warm.
`eas build --profile simulator-release --platform ios` produces the same thing
in about ten minutes and is the fallback.

## The App Review plan

```bash
OMG_E2E_EMAIL=appreview@omg.dev OMG_REVIEW_CODE=<code> \
  bun run test:e2e --plan reviewer --record
```

`reviewer.plan.json` walks what App Review walks: Welcome, the sign-in
drawer, the demo account, its FIXED code, the data notice, and the
signed-in session list. `OMG_REVIEW_CODE` short-circuits the Gmail read,
because that code never arrives by mail. The code lives in App Store Connect
and in the environment. It is NOT in this repository, which is public.

The last step exists for one regression: on 2026-09-17 the list rendered
empty while the demo box held real sessions, which reads as a broken app.
`forbid: ["No sessions yet"]` fails by name if that returns.

Run it before every submission, and re-read
`docs/ASC-LISTING-READINESS.md` for the state of the demo Computer.

## Static flows

`--flow NAME` runs `NAME.yaml` with `maestro test`; `--flow onboarding` runs
the two-half YAML version in `onboarding/` (kept as the fallback when Jev is
unreachable). New proofs are plans, not flows.

### Rate of runs

Auth challenges the fourth code send from one IP inside an hour
(`apps/auth/src/signin-risk.ts` in vibes, `IP_BURST_SENDS`). The app sends a
browser `Origin` and has no Turnstile, so the send fails with "Please confirm
you are a person, then try again." and the flow stops there by name. Three
onboarding runs per hour per Mac, including any manual sign-ins from that
Mac, is the ceiling.

## Do not put `launchApp` in a flow yet

The simulator carries a **development build**. `launchApp` restarts the app
with no Metro attached, and the app lands on the Expo dev-client launcher
("Searching for development servers...") instead of your UI. Every later
assertion then fails for a reason that has nothing to do with your change.

These flows therefore assume the app is already loaded. That is fine locally
and useless in CI.

`launchApp` becomes safe once a standalone build with the bundle embedded is
installed on the device:

```bash
bun run test:e2e --build          # Xcode on the Mac, about 45s warm
eas build --profile simulator-release --platform ios   # the fallback, about 10 min
```

Add `launchApp` at that point, not before.

## Selectors

Read the screen with `bun run test:e2e --inspect` and copy strings verbatim.

- Use `text:`. Maestro's `text:` matcher is **full-string regex, IGNORE_CASE**,
  so a partial string does NOT match. Anchor with `.*` if you need a prefix.
- iOS `accessibilityText` maps to `text:`. Never write `accessibilityText:` or
  `a11y:` as a selector key. Maestro does not accept them.
- Prefer `id:` where the element has a stable `resource-id`. Most of this app
  does not yet. Add `testID` props as you touch screens.
