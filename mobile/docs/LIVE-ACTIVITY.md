# Live Activity

Status: **iOS 1.0.6 (46) uploaded and Apple processing VALID. Hosted lifecycle and
production APNs credentials deployed on 2026-09-13 at vibes `12cc4f7d3`.**

Production readback confirms matching source hashes, the token table, loaded APNs
configuration, and a successful fleet-status route probe. Apple responds to a
synthetic token with `BadDeviceToken`; this verifies connectivity, not phone delivery.
No device was registered at verification time. Open build 46 and select a user-owned
Computer to register the phone. Physical-device start/update/end remain unverified.

## Native redesign

The pending 1.0.8 binary adds session rows, bundled agent marks, and a native
first-use widget preview. The widget gallery and preview use the name `omg.dev`.
The widget kind remains `OmgAgentVillage`, so existing placements keep their identity.

This does not change ordinary notification icons. Gmail-style notification icons
were discussed in the source session but have not been implemented.

## Implemented path

```
lfg connect → relay → hosted control plane → APNs → ActivityKit
                                              ↑
                               iOS registers both token types
```

- `src/commands/connect.ts` sends `fleet.status` only when the aggregate changes.
- `src/omg/agent-live-activity.tsx` defines the lock-screen and Dynamic Island views.
- `expo-widgets` generates the Widget Extension and enables push-to-start.
- The hosted control plane stores tokens and owns start, update, and end pushes.
- The lock screen receives counts and up to three session rows (id, short title,
  agent identity, and state), plus a total for overflow. Titles are limited to
  72 characters and truncated to one visual line. The user approved title display
  in the September 14 redesign. Prompts, questions, transcripts, and separate
  project fields are excluded. IDs are deep-link targets and are not displayed.
- The lock screen and expanded Island show title rows. Compact mode uses a static
  cluster of bundled agent marks. Unknown agents use the omg mark; missing titles
  use the agent name. Older count-only senders keep a usable summary.
- Agent marks and the village gallery backgrounds are bundled in the extension.
  An empty widget timeline receives a native garden preview before app data exists.
  The app remains the sole owner of the real village timeline.
- These extension assets and the gallery fallback require a new native binary
  (runtime 1.0.8). An OTA for 1.0.7 cannot add them.

The hosted control plane needs these secrets:

- `OMG_APNS_KEY_ID`
- `OMG_APNS_TEAM_ID`
- `OMG_APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `OMG_APNS_ENV=sandbox` for development builds. Production is the default.

This first version follows the currently selected, user-owned Computer. Cloud Computers
and Computers shared by another user do not register a Live Activity.

## Original design record

## The ask

A Live Activity on the lock screen / Dynamic Island showing: how many agent sessions are
running, how many are blocked and need input, and a one-line preview of one pending
question. Tapping it should behave like tapping a push notification — deep-link into the
app.

## What this needs, mechanically

A Live Activity is not a special notification. It's a small SwiftUI view driven by
**WidgetKit + ActivityKit**, and it does not run as part of the main app target — it runs
as a **Widget Extension**, a second Xcode target that ships inside the same `.ipa`. There
is no way to have a Live Activity without one; that's an ActivityKit constraint, not
something Expo chooses to make hard.

What the extension target needs:

- `NSSupportsLiveActivities = YES` in the **main app's** Info.plist (not the extension's).
- An `ActivityAttributes` struct — the static data an activity is started with (in our
  case: probably nothing, or a stable identifier) — plus a nested `ContentState: Codable`
  struct: the fields that change over the activity's life. For this feature that's the
  three things Benny asked for: running count, blocked count, one question preview
  (trimmed — content-state payloads are capped at roughly 4KB, consistent across several
  sources though I didn't pin it to one Apple doc paragraph).
- SwiftUI views for the lock-screen presentation and the three Dynamic Island states
  (compact / minimal / expanded).
- An **App Group** shared between the app target and the extension, if the app itself
  ever needs to read/write the same state (not strictly required if the activity is
  driven entirely by push).

iOS floor: Live Activities shipped in **16.1**. **Push-to-start** — starting an activity
from a server push rather than in-app code — needs **17.2**. Both are old enough now not
to be a practical constraint, but they set the floor.

## Two ways to drive it, and which one this feature needs

**Local** (`Activity.request(attributes:content:)` to start, `.update(content:)` to
push new state, `.end(...)` to close) only runs while the app can execute Swift code —
foreground, or a background task window. That's the wrong shape for this feature: the
whole point is showing fleet state while the app is closed, which is exactly when local
updates can't fire.

**Push-driven** is the actual requirement, and it's a genuinely different push type from
everything `push-native.ts` sends today:

- Header `apns-push-type: liveactivity` (today's notifications don't set this).
- **A different topic**: `<bundle-id>.push-type.liveactivity` — for us,
  `dev.omg.computer.push-type.liveactivity` — not the app's normal APNs topic. Expo's
  push relay is built around ordinary alert notifications; whether it forwards
  Live-Activity-shaped pushes with the right push-type/topic is not something I could
  confirm without either finding it explicitly documented or trying it, so treat "does
  the same Expo relay work here" as open, not assumed.
- **Push-to-start** (event: `"start"`, plus `attributes-type`, `attributes`,
  `content-state`) needs the device to have registered a **push-to-start token** — a
  distinct token from the per-activity update token, requested once (iOS 17.2+, no
  running activity required) versus the per-activity token that only exists after an
  activity has actually started.
- **Push-update** (event: `"update"`, `content-state`) needs that per-activity token,
  obtained locally via `Activity.pushTokenUpdates` after the activity starts (by local
  code or by a push-to-start).
- `event: "end"` to close it remotely (e.g. when nothing is running or blocked anymore).

So the actual data flow, if built: the machine already knows "N running, M blocked, this
question" (it's the same fleet state `session-push.ts`'s watcher already samples). It
would need to push-to-start on the first relevant state, hold the per-activity token
(another token store, alongside `push-native.ts`'s — a Live Activity token is not an Expo
push token and doesn't belong in the same file), and push-update on every fleet tick that
changes the numbers. That's meaningfully chattier than today's "notify on a settled
busy→idle edge" model — a Live Activity is closer to "keep this in sync continuously"
than "wake someone up once." Rate limiting / coalescing rapid changes would need real
thought before shipping, not assumed away.

## What Expo can and can't do here (checked 2026-08-15, some of this only as documented — not verified in this repo)

This is the part that actually decides the cost, and it moved recently:

- Expo shipped an **official but alpha** `expo-widgets` library (~SDK 55, per Expo's own
  blog) that builds both home-screen widgets and Live Activities as **React components**,
  with the config plugin generating the Widget Extension target, App Group, and
  Info.plist keys at prebuild time — and it claims push-to-start/push-update support.
  If it works as documented, this is the cheap path: no hand-written SwiftUI, mostly
  React + config plugin + EAS credentials. The catch: it's explicitly alpha ("APIs may
  change"), and there's an open, maintainer-acknowledged GitHub issue reporting widgets /
  Live Activities rendering **blank** on SDK ~55. I have not tried it against SDK 57 in
  this repo — I was told not to touch build/credentials, and this is a design doc, not a
  spike.
- The previous community option, `software-mansion-labs/expo-live-activity` (supported
  local + push, 16.2 floor), is now **archived** and its own README points at
  `expo-widgets` as the successor. Not a live option for new work.
- `EvanBacon/expo-apple-targets` (actively maintained, general-purpose "inject an Apple
  target via config plugin") is the fallback if `expo-widgets` doesn't pan out: it does
  the Xcode-surgery part (new target, entitlements, App Group) but leaves the
  ActivityAttributes/ContentState model and every SwiftUI view to be hand-written.
- Either way, **EAS Build does support building a project with an extra app-extension
  target** — this is documented (not a hard EAS limitation), gated behind
  `extra.eas.build.experimental.ios.appExtensions` in app.json, marked experimental for
  managed/CNG projects. It provisions the extension's own bundle id, entitlements, and
  credentials as part of the normal build.

**Bottom line on custom native module vs. existing plugin:** don't hand-roll a bespoke
config plugin from scratch. Start with `expo-widgets` given it's now Expo's own answer
to this exact feature — but validate it first with a disposable EAS dev-client build
before committing engineering time to the full feature, specifically checking whether
the blank-render issue reproduces on SDK 57. If it doesn't hold up, `@bacons/apple-targets`
plus hand-written Swift is the realistic fallback, not a from-scratch native module either
way — ActivityKit itself is Apple's API surface regardless of which plugin injects the
target.

## State model (for whichever path is picked)

```
ContentState:
  runningCount: Int
  blockedCount: Int
  questionPreview: String?   // trimmed; no more of the real question than a
                              // push notification already gets — see push-native.ts's
                              // redaction rationale, same argument applies here, more so:
                              // this sits on the lock screen continuously, not for the
                              // few seconds a banner is up.
  updatedAt: Date             // so a stale activity can say so rather than lie
```

Attributes (static, set once at start): nothing session-specific comes to mind — probably
just enough to identify "the omg fleet activity" if more than one activity type ever
exists.

The `questionPreview` redaction point matters more here than for a push banner: a banner
disappears; a Live Activity is pinned to the lock screen for as long as it's live. Same
"never the real text, name what it's about" call made in `push-native.ts` applies, harder.

## Cost, honestly

Not "a few days, drop in a package." Two bands depending on how `expo-widgets` alpha
actually holds up on SDK 57 — a question only a build can answer:

- **If `expo-widgets` works**: roughly a week — config plugin + React-authored widget
  views + EAS credentials/entitlements wiring + a new push-to-start/push-update sender on
  the machine reusing the fleet watcher.
- **If it doesn't** (the blank-render issue, alpha churn, or missing push support in
  practice): `@bacons/apple-targets` + hand-written SwiftUI/ActivityKit — a real native
  surface with its own Xcode build/test loop, reviewed and maintained outside the normal
  JS path — more like 1–3 weeks, plus ongoing maintenance the JS-only parts of this app
  don't have.

Either way, it needs its own EAS credentials work beyond the APNs key Phase 1 needs
(the extension's bundle id needs provisioning too), and a first spike to de-risk before
committing to a full build.
